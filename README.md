# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Problem Statement 3â€“ Natural language processing
 Title: AI-Assisted Learning for NVIDIA SDKs and Toolkits
 Problem Statement: Develop an AI-powered language model (LLM) that assists users in
 understanding and effectively using various NVIDIA SDKs (Software Development Kits) and
 toolkits. The objective of this hackathon is to create an interactive and user-friendly platform
 that provides comprehensive information, examples, and guidance on NVIDIA's SDKs and
 toolkits. By leveraging the power of language models and NVIDIA toolkits, participants aim to
 simplify the learning curve for developers and empower them to utilize NVIDIA's technologies
 more efficiently.
