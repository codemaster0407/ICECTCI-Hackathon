Logging
For logging Carbonite is used.
By default info level logging is written to a file. Path to log file is written to stdout among the first lines when Kit starts.
At runtime path to a log file can be found in setting: /log/file or using ${logs} token.

Python Logging
Python standard logging is redirected to Carbonite logger and it is recommended to use it instead.


Code Examples

Logging with python
# Logging/Log

# Carbonite logger is used both for python and C++:
import carb
carb.log_info("123")
carb.log_warn("456")
carb.log_error("789")

# For python it is recommended to use std python logging, which also redirected to Carbonite
# It also captures file path and loc
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("123")
logger.warning("456")
logger.error("789")




Logging with C++
#include <carb/logging/Log.h>
