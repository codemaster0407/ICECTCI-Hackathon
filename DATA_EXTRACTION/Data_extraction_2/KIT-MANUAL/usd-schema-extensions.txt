USD Schema ExtensionsÔÉÅ
USD libraries are part of omni.usd.libs extension and are loaded as one of the first extensions to ensure that USD dlls are available to other extensions.
USD schemas itself are each an individual extension that can be a part of any repository. USD schema extensions are loaded after omni.usd.libs and ideally before omni.usd.
Example of a schema extension config.toml file:
[core]
reloadable = false
# Load at the start, load all schemas with order -100 (with order -1000 the USD libs are loaded)
order = -100

[package]
category = "Simulation"
keywords = ["physics", "usd"]

# pxr modules to load
[[python.module]]
name = "pxr.UsdPhysics"

# python loader module
[[python.module]]
name = "usd.physics.schema"

# pxr libraries to be preloaded
[[native.library]]
path = "bin/${lib_prefix}usdPhysics${lib_ext}"


Schema extensions contain pxr::Schema, its plugin registry and config.toml definition file. Additionally it contains a loading module omni/schema/_schema_name that does have python init.py file containing the plugin registry code.
Example:
import os
from pxr import Plug

pluginsRoot = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../../plugins')
physicsSchemaPath = pluginsRoot + '/UsdPhysics/resources'

Plug.Registry().RegisterPlugins(physicsSchemaPath)
