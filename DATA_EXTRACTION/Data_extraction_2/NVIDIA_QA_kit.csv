0,What is Kit?,"Kit is a platform for building applications and experiences. They may or may not have much in common. Some of these may use RTX, omni.ui, or other libraries to create rich applications, while others may be cut-down windowless services."
1,What is the main goal of Kit?,"The main goal of Kit is to be extremely modular, where everything is an extension."
2,What is an Extension in Kit?,"An Extension is a uniquely named and versioned package loaded at runtime. It can contain python code, shared libraries, and/or Carbonite plugins. It provides a C++ API and a python API. Extensions can depend on other extensions and can be reloadable, meaning they can be unloaded, changed, and loaded again at runtime."
3,How does an Extension contribute to Kit-based Applications?,"An Extension is the basic building block of Kit-based Applications like Create, as it provides the necessary functionality and features to enhance the applications."
4,What is the Kit Kernel (kit.exe/IApp)?,"The Kit Kernel, also known as kit.exe/IApp, is a minimal core required to run an extension. It acts as an entry point for any Kit-based Application and includes the extension manager and basic interface, serving as the core that holds everything together."
5,What does the Kit Kernel include?,The Kit Kernel includes the extension manager and a basic interface that allows extensions to interact with the core functionalities of the Kit-based Application.
6,What does omni.kit.app (omni::kit::IApp) contain?,"omni.kit.app is a basic interface that can be used by any extension. It provides a minimal set of Carbonite plugins to load and set up extensions. It contains Carbonite framework startup, the extension manager, event system, update loop, settings, and a Python context/runtime."
7,What are the programming language options to interact with omni.kit.app?,omni.kit.app can be used with C++ using omni::kit::IApp or with Python using omni.kit.app.
8,What are Bundled Extensions in the Kit SDK?,Bundled Extensions are included extensions that come with the Kit SDK. They provide additional functionalities for the Kit platform.
9,Where can other extensions be found?,Other extensions can be developed outside of the Kit SDK and delivered using the Extension Registry.
10,What are Different Modes Example?,Different Modes Example shows different scenarios of using Kit-based Applications with various extensions and dependencies.
11,What are the different dependencies shown in the GUI CLI utility mode?,"In the GUI CLI utility mode, the dependencies include omni.kit.rendering, omni.kit.window, omni.kit.ui, omni.kit.usd, omni.kit.connection, and user.tool.ui."
12,What is a Kit file?,"A Kit file (ends in .kit) defines an Omniverse App. It behaves as a single-file extension and can be published, downloaded, versioned, and have dependencies."
13,How do you build an Omniverse App using a Kit file?,Building an Omniverse App is as simple as listing the extensions it should contain (extension dependencies) and the default settings to apply in the Kit file.
14,What is an example of a simple app in Kit?,"An example of a very simple app in Kit is the 'repl.kit' file, which includes a dependency and a setting applied to the 'omni.kit.console' extension."
15,What will the Kit executable do when passed the 'repl.kit' file?,"When you pass the 'repl.kit' file to the Kit executable using the command 'kit.exe repl.kit', it will enable a few extensions (including dependencies) to run a simple REPL."
16,What are the conceptual differences between specifying dependencies for an extension and an app?,"For extensions, dependencies are specified broadly to describe compatibility with other extensions. An extension can be used in various apps with different extensions included. For an app, all versions of dependencies must be locked in the final package to guarantee reproducible builds for end users and developers."
17,How does Kit resolve extension versions when running an app?,"When running an app, Kit will first resolve all extension versions, either locally or using the registry system, and then enable the latest compatible versions. Subsequent runs of the app may result in different versions being enabled if newer versions have been published."
18,What is the purpose of the repo tool 'repo_precache_exts'?,The 'repo_precache_exts' tool is used to lock the versions of all extensions required by an app and also download/precache them. It is run as the final step of the build process to package the extensions together with the app for deployment.
19,What happens when the 'repo_precache_exts' tool is run with the '-u' or '--update' flag?,"When the 'repo_precache_exts' tool is run with the '-u' or '--update' flag, it removes the generated part of the kit file, cleans the cache path, and then reruns the extension precaching process to update the version lock."
20,What are the version specification recommendations for apps in Kit?,"The general advice is to write the dependencies required-versions for apps the same way as for extensions, in an open-ended form. For example, you can specify dependencies without a specific version or lock them to a major version while allowing minor updates."
21,What happens when an extension is specified as exact in the version lock?,Extensions specified as exact in the version lock are not automatically updated by the version lock process. This allows you to manually lock the version for a specific platform or purpose.
22,How is an app deployed in Omniverse Launcher?,"An app in Omniverse Launcher is composed of one or more Kit files, precached extensions, and the Kit SDK. It can be run by anyone who has access to the Kit file and can be shared as a file for easy distribution."
23,What is the goal for deploying apps in Omniverse Launcher?,"The goal is to have a single Kit file that defines an Omniverse App of any complexity, which can be published, versioned, and easily shared with others, simplifying the deployment process."
24,What is exts.deps.generated.kit?,exts.deps.generated.kit is an app that contains all extensions from the repository as dependencies. It is used to lock all versions of their dependencies and precache them before building.
25,How is the exts.deps.generated.kit file regenerated?,"The exts.deps.generated.kit file is regenerated if any extension is added, removed, or if any extension version is updated in the repository."
26,What is the purpose of the Kit configuration system?,"The Kit configuration system is based on Carbonite settings and provides a runtime representation of configuration formats like json, toml, and xml. It is a nested dictionary of values used to configure various aspects of Kit-based applications."
27,How do you start Kit without loading any app file?,"To start Kit without loading any app file, you can run 'kit.exe' without any arguments. It will start Kit and exit without enabling any extensions or applying any configuration, except for the built-in config: kit-core.json."

For example, 'kit.exe --enable omni.kit.window.script_editor --ext-folder ./exts --enable foo.bar' will enable the specified extensions and search for additional extensions in the './exts' folder."
32,What is a Kit file and how is it used?,"A Kit file is the recommended way to configure applications in Kit. It is a single-file extension, similar to an extension.toml file, that defines settings for an application. It can be named, versioned, and even published to the registry like any other extension."
33,How can you define dependencies for a Kit file?,"Dependencies for a Kit file are defined in the '[dependencies]' section using the format 'extension_name = {}'. For example, '[dependencies]
""omni.kit.window.script_editor"" = {}' defines a dependency on the 'omni.kit.window.script_editor' extension."
34,What are the different places to put system-wide configuration files to override settings?,"System-wide configuration files to override settings can be placed in various locations, including '${shared_documents}/user.toml', '${app_documents}/user.toml', '<app .kit file>\<0 or more levels above>\deps\user.toml', '<app .kit file>\<0 or more levels above>\deps\[app_name]\user.toml', '${shared_program_data}/kit.config.toml', and '${app_program_data}/kit.config.toml'."
35,How do you use the special '++' key to append values to arrays?,"The '++' key is used to append values to arrays instead of overriding them. For example, to add additional extension folders to the '/app/exts/folders' setting, you can use: '[app.exts]\nfolders.""++"" = [""c:/temp""]'. This adds the 'c:/temp' folder to the list of extension folders."

92,What is the best way to document Python API?,"The best way to document Python API is to use Python Docstring format (Google Python Style Docstring). This involves providing one-liner descriptions, more detailed behavior explanations, Args and Returns sections, all while utilizing Python type hints."
93,What approach should be taken for documenting C++ code that is exposed to Python using pybind11?,"For documenting C++ code exposed to Python via pybind11, the same Google Python Style Docstring format should be used. The pybind11 library automatically generates type information based on C++ types, and py::arg objects must be used to properly name arguments in the function signature."
94,How can Sphinx warnings be dealt with during the documentation process?,"To address Sphinx warnings, it is crucial to fix issues with MyST-parser warnings, docstring syntax, and C++ docstring problems. Properly managing __all__ in Python modules helps control which members are inspected and documented. Also, ensuring consistent indentation and whitespace in docstrings is essential."
95,What are some common sources of docstring syntax warnings?,"Common sources of docstring syntax warnings include indentation or whitespace mismatches in docstrings, improper usage or lack of newlines where required, and usage of asterisks or backticks in C++ docstrings."
96,How can API extensions be added to the automatic-introspection documentation system?,"To add API extensions to the automatic-introspection documentation system, you need to opt-in the extension to the new system. This involves adding the extension to the list of extensions, providing an Overview.md file in the appropriate folder, and adding markdown files to the extension.toml configuration file."
97,Why is it important to properly manage __all__ in Python modules?,"Managing __all__ in Python modules helps control which objects are imported when using 'from module import *' syntax. This improves documentation generation speed, prevents unwanted autosummary stubs, optimizes import-time, unclutters imported namespaces, and reduces duplicate object Sphinx warnings."
98,What is the purpose of the 'deps' section in the extension.toml configuration file?,The 'deps' section in the extension.toml file specifies extension dependencies and links or Sphinx ref-targets to existing projects. It allows the documentation system to resolve type references and generate proper links to other objects that are part of the documentation.

134,What does the omni.kit.app subsystem define?,"The omni.kit.app subsystem defines the minimal set of functionality that Kit Core provides, including loop runner entry point, extension manager, scripting support, general message bus, shutdown sequence management, and hang detector."
135,What are the initial wires an extension gets from the external extension point?,"From the external extension point of view, the only wires that an extension gets initially are just the startup and shutdown functions."
136,What is the role of the loop runner in an application?,"The loop runner drives the application loop, pushing update events into corresponding update event streams and pumping the event streams, allowing modular bits and pieces to tick."
137,What is the default implementation of the loop runner?,"The default loop runner is close to the straightforward implementation outlined in the pseudocode, with small additions of rate limiter logic and other minor pieces of maintenance logic."
138,What does the extension manager control?,"The extension manager controls the extensions execution flow, maintains the extension registry, and handles other related tasks."
139,How can Python scripting be set up and managed?,"The Kit Core app sets up Python scripting environment required to support Python extensions and execute custom Python scripts and code snippets. The IAppScripting interface provides a simple interface to this scripting environment, which can be used to execute files and strings, manage script search folders, and subscribe to the event stream that broadcasts scripting events."
140,What is the purpose of the general message bus?,The general message bus is an event stream that can be used by anyone to send and listen to events. It is useful in cases where event stream ownership is inconvenient or when app-wide events are established that can be used by many consumers across all the extensions.
141,How can an event type be derived from a string hash for the message bus?,An event type can be derived from a string hash using functions like carb.events.type_from_string.
142,How does the application handle shutdown requests?,"The application receives shutdown requests via the post-quit queries. Prior to the real shutdown initiation, the post query event will be injected into the shutdown event stream, and consumers subscribed to the event stream will have a chance to request a shutdown request cancellation. If the shutdown is not cancelled, another event will be injected into the shutdown event stream, indicating that the real shutdown is about to start."
143,What does the app core incorporate to detect hangs?,"The app core incorporates a simple hang detector that receives periodic nudges, and if there are no nudges for some defined amount of time, it will notify the user that a hang is detected and can crash the application if the user chooses."
144,Why is the hang detector helpful?,"The hang detector helps generate crash dumps, allowing developers to understand what happened and what the call stack was at the time of the hang."
145,What are the settings that can be tweaked for the hang detector?,"The timeout, if it is enabled, and other things can be tweaked via the settings."
146,What are some important design choices for event streams?,Either multiple event streams with fairly limited numbers of event types served by each or one single event stream serving many different event types.
147,How can you execute your code only on Nth event using transient subscriptions?,"The transient subscription can include a simple counter, so you execute your code only on Nth event, not necessarily on the next one."
148,What is the purpose of the carb::events::IEvents Carbonite interface?,The carb::events::IEvents Carbonite interface is used to provide a means to move data around using the generalized interface in a thread-safe manner and synchronize the logic.
149,How are event consumers able to subscribe to callbacks?,"Subscription functions create the ISubscription class, which usually unsubscribes automatically upon destruction."
150,What are some important recommendations for using the events subsystem?,"The events subsystem is flexible, and there are several recommendations intended to help with frequent use-cases and provide clarifications on specific parts of the events logic."
151,What is the carb.events plugin's goal?,The goal of the carb.events plugin is to provide a means to move data around using the generalized interface in a thread-safe manner and also act as a way to synchronize the logic.
152,What happens when events are popped from the event queue?,"When events are popped from the queue one by one or all at once (pump), deferred callbacks are triggered."
153,What does the omni.kit.app subsystem define?,"The omni.kit.app subsystem defines the minimal set of functionality that Kit Core provides, including loop runner entry point, extension manager, scripting support, general message bus, shutdown sequence management, and hang detector."
154,What are the initial wires an extension gets from the external extension point?,"From the external extension point of view, the only wires that an extension gets initially are just the startup and shutdown functions."
155,What is the role of the loop runner in an application?,"The loop runner drives the application loop, pushing update events into corresponding update event streams and pumping the event streams, allowing modular bits and pieces to tick."
156,What is the purpose of Omniverse Kit?,"Omniverse Kit is the SDK for building Omniverse applications like Create and View. It brings together major components such as USD/Hydra, Omniverse, Carbonite, Omniverse RTX Renderer, Scripting, and a UI Toolkit (omni.ui)."
157,What can developers use Omniverse Kit for?,Developers can use Omniverse Kit to build their own Omniverse applications or extend and modify existing ones using any combination of its major components.
158,What is USD/Hydra?,"USD is the primary Scene Description used by Kit, both for in-memory/authoring/runtime use and as the serialization format. Hydra allows USD to stream its content to any Renderer with a Hydra Scene Delegate."
159,How can USD be accessed in an extension?,USD can be accessed directly via an external shared library or from Python using USD’s own Python bindings.
160,What is Omni.USD?,"Omni.USD is an API written in C++ that sits on top of USD, Kit’s core, and the OmniClient library. It provides application-related services such as Events/Listeners, Selection handling, access to the Omniverse USD Audio subsystem, and more."
161,What does the Omniverse Client Library do?,The Omniverse Client Library is used by Omniverse clients like Kit to communicate with Omniverse servers and local filesystems when loading and saving assets.
162,What functionality does the Carbonite SDK provide?,"The Carbonite SDK provides core functionality for all Omniverse apps, including plugin management, input handling, file access, persistent settings management, audio support, asset loading and management, thread and task management, image loading, localization, synchronization, and basic windowing."
163,How are Carbonite Plugins implemented?,"Carbonite Plugins are shared libraries with C-style interfaces, and most of them have Python bindings"
