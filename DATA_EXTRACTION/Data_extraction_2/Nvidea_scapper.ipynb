They may or may not have much in common. Some of these may use RTX, omni.ui or other libraries to create rich applications, others may be cut-down windowless services (e.g one to process USD files offline for example). To achieve this goal, Kit aims to be extremely modular: everything is an extension .   Extensions   An Extension is a uniquely named and versioned package loaded at runtime. It can have any or all of the following properties:   Contain python code.  Contain shared libraries and/or Carbonite plugins.  Provide a C++ API.  Provide a python API.  Depend on other extensions.  Be reloadable (can be unloaded, changed and loaded again at runtime).   It is the basic building block of Kit-based Applications like Create. More info in the Extensions part of the guide.    Kit Kernel ( kit.exe / IApp )   Is a minimal core required to run an extension. It is an entry point for any Kit-based Application. It includes extension manager and basic interface. It is the core which holds everything together.    omni.kit.app ( omni::kit::IApp )   omni.kit.app is the basic interface that can be used by any extension, and provides a minimal set of Carbonite plugins to load and set up extensions. It is the main front part of Kit Kernel.  C++: omni::kit::IApp python: omni.kit.app  It contains:   Carbonite framework startup  Extension manager  Event system  Update loop  Settings  Python context / runtime (edited)   It can run from either a Kit executable ( kit.exe / kit ) or from python.    Bundled Extensions   The Kit SDK comes with a lot of included extensions. Even more extensions are developed outside of Kit SDK and delivered using Extension Registry.   Note  Try kit.exe  --list-exts and then enable one of them, e.g. kit.exe  --enable  omni.usd     Different Modes Example    CLI utility   graph RL\r\n",

Each extension can depend on other extensions and this is where the whole application tree can unroll. The user may enable a high level extension like omni.usd_viewer which will bring in dozens of others.\n",
      "An extension can express dependencies on other extensions using name, version and optionally tag. It is important to keep extensions versioned properly and express breaking changes using Semantic Versioning.\n",
      "This is a good place to grasp what tag is for. If extension foo depends on bar, you might implement other versions of bar, like: bar-light, bar-prototype. If they still fulfill the same API contract and expected behavior, you can safely substitute bar without foo noticing. In other words if the extension is an interface, tag is the implementation.\n",
      "The effect is that just enabling some high-level extensions like omni.kit.window.script_editor will expand the whole dependency tree in the correct order without the user having to specify all of them or worry about initialization order.\n",
      "One can also substitute extensions in a tree with a different version or tag, towards the same end-user experience, but having swapped in-place a different low-level building block.\n",
      "When an extension is enabled, the manager tries to satisfy all of its dependencies by recursively solving the dependency graph. This is a difficult problem - If dependency resolution succeeds the whole dependency tree is enabled in-order so that all dependents are enabled first. The opposite is true for disabling extensions. All extensions which depend on the target extension are disabled first. More details on the dependency system can be found in the C++ unit tests: source/tests/test.unit/ext/TestExtensions.cpp\n",
      "A Dependency graph defines the order in which extensions are loaded - it is sorted topologically. There are however, many ways to sort the same graph (think of independent branches). To give finer control over startup order, the order parameters can be used. Each extension can use core.order config parameter to define its order and the order of dependencies can also be overriden with order param in [[dependencies]] section. Those with lower order will start sooner. If there are multiple extensions that depend on one extension and are trying to override this order then the one that is loaded last will be used (according to dependency tree). In summary - the dependency order is always satisfied (or extensions won’t be started at all, if the graph contains cycles) and soft ordering is applied on top using config params.\n",

      "Building Extensions\n",
      "Extensions are a runtime concept. This guide doesn’t describe how to build them or how to build other extensions which mihht depend on another specific extension at build-time. One can use a variety of different tools and setups for that. We do however have some best-practice recommendations. The best sources of information on that topic are currently:\n",
      "The example omni.example.hello extension (and many other extensions). Copy and rename it to create a new extension.\n",
      "We also strive to use folder linking as much as possible. Meaning we don’t copy python files and configs from the source folder to the target (build) folder, but link them. This permits live changes to those files under version control to be immediately reflected, even at runtime. Unfortunately we can’t link files, because of Windows limitations, so folder linking is used. This adds some verbosity to the way the folder structure is organized.\n",
      "For example, for a simple python-only extension, we link the whole python namespace subfolder:\n",
      "source/extensions/omni.example.hello/omni – [linked to] –> _build/windows-x86_64/debug/exts/omni.example.hello/omni\n",
      "For an extension with binary components we link python code parts and copy binary parts.\n",
      "We specify other parts to link in the premake file: repo_build.prebuild_link { \"folder\", ext.target_dir..\"/folder\" }\n",
      "When working with the build system it is always a good idea to look at what the final _build/windows-x86_64/debug/exts folder looks like, which folder links exist, where they point to, which files were copied, etc. Remember that the goal is to produce one extension folder which will potentially be zipped and published. Folder links are just zipped as-is, as if they were actual folders.\n"

      "\n",
      "PanelA panel is a user interface (UI) element within Omniverse Applications that contains other UI elements. You can often dock a panel into a position within a window, and you typically access panels with tabs.\n",

      "PayloadA payload is a USD layer operation that you use to point from one prim to another, like a reference. The key difference between payloads and references is that payloads are not always consumed when a stage is built. Payloads are weaker than references, and if you decide not to load them, they’ll will be recorded, but not consumed.\n",

      "\n",
      "PrimShort for “primitive”, the prim is the fundamental unit in Omniverse. Anything imported or created in a USD scene is a prim. This includes, cameras, sounds, lights, meshes, and more. Primitives are technically containers of metadata, properties, and other prims. Read more about USD prims in the official documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "ReferenceA reference is a USD layer operation that you use to point from one prim to another. In doing so, you can compose a scene description, called a namespace, from smaller components. Within the namespace, referenced prims have their own, unique names. When you load a scene, referenced USD files are opened only once, even if they are used multiple times in the namespace. Finally, when a stage is built, references are always consumed. This is a key distinction between references and payloads.\n",
