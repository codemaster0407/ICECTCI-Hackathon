So i will ask again, why the FBI security when it comes to using an SDK on a laptop that we already have to authenticate?I have complained how useless and painful it is to login to just flash the jetsons we bought. We need to click several times on bicycles etc and now we have to go through an authenticator app??? Does NVIDIA realise we dont want more MFA tokens on our phone?This time though, updating the SDK MAnager asked me to log in, go through MFA and then it downloaded the update files and then the update failed…So much work is being done on something that brings such little to no value to us (your security) and i’ve been complaining to you about how slow you are when it comes to delivering wheels for python3.7 which is old now, ive been complaining about having to recompile the code binary tree just to enable SPI and many other things that makes the jetson inferior to a hobby project like the raspberry pi…All that effort that went into security could have gone into the stuff that we actually need:
Support for wheels for newest OS etc
Better documentation
Enable SPI in some setting somehow (check raspberry pi)
Make it easier to flash
and many more shortcomings I have mentioned in my posts.I was the first one to publicly post the wheels for tensorflow gpu 1.15 for python 3.7 because camera manufacturers like Allied Vision etc only work on python 3.7So what is NVIDIA’s plan? More security?This is frustratingHi @LeMoth, You might want to post this over in the Jetson forums, as there are no technical resources monitoring this category.

error13839×1979 679 KB
I’m not sure where to post this error. There’s no obvious place to go for help with DLI. I tried to open a ticket here, https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/support/consumer/ which requires me to login even through I’m already logged in. However, the login doesn’t work.Thanks for your help.Hi @FractalMath,Welcome to the NVIDIA Developer forums. Unfortunately, there is no DLI forum at the moment. Let me see if I can find someone from the DLI team to help here.Best,
TomHi @FractalMath, thanks so much for reaching out for support. I maintain this training and hope that I can be of service.I attempted to duplicate your error and was unable to do so. When I visit the training and do make profile from within section 04, everything works as expected.That said, I believe that if you spin up the content again, you will likely find it working as expected, though please let me know if that is not the case.I was able to find a bit more information on the error you displayed on this Developer Forum Thread. It looks like there is some kind of timeout occurring with QdstrmImporter which can often be caused by either a massive qstrm file, which I have no reason to believe is true in your case, or perhaps some underlying issue on the VM you were working on. If it were the latter, it is my hope that restarting the training will solve the issue for you.Again, please do let me know if restarting the content does not solve your issue and I’ll be eager to help get you unblocked. Thanks so much for your interest in the course.Hi @jwyatt, I spun up the content two additional times and the same problem remains. The file baseline-report.qdstrm is 57k. The QdstrmImporter takes a very long time during the import before it errors out.Thanks for your help.Hi @FractalMath, sorry to hear that did not resolve the issue for you.I was able to replicate the error, though I had to generate the report 3 times before running into it. I’m still not certain what the root cause is (though I will report it back to you when I know), though I do have a solution that will get you unstuck.Following the advice of this forum post, we are able to turn off CPU sampling and only trace the CUDA APIs (which is what we are interested in for this material) by adding the nsys flags --sample=none --trace=cuda. Thus, a full profile command would look something like nsys profile --stats=true --force-overwrite=true --sample=none --trace=cuda -o baseline-report ./baseline. I tried this out and it works, and, gives me everything I need within the Nsight Systems GUI.I will look to resolve this issue more at the root when I’m able, and will also queue up edits to the content so that the use of Makefile is enabled once again without error.Please let me know if you have any issues going forward, and thanks again for reaching out.Adding those flags worked.Thank you for your help.Happy to help, and sorry again for the inconvenience.I’ve been able to discover that this issue was a known issue with earlier versions of Nsight Systems and has since been addressed. Therefore I updated the course to use the very latest version of Nsight Compute (version 2021.1) and I can confirm that it solves the issue you reported.Again, thanks so much for reporting the issue, your feedback helps us make sure the course is in its best possible configuration.Please let us know if we can be of further support.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

We hope you will find this site intuitive and clearly structured, but here is some guidance to get you started:Here are some very basic terms that will be helpful to keep in mind as you use the NVIDIA Developer Forums or read this guide:By default, the Developer Forums homepage will show all Latest conversations in the community but you can filter this list in a number of ways:There are several ways to see who is involved in topics.On the homepage you will see a selection of avatars (profile pictures) of:The box at the bottom of the OP tells you; who created the post and when, gives a count of the replies and views in this topic to date, and a display of the avatars of the most frequent participants.A healthy community needs members to be posting new content, but this activity is not everything. Readers are the true indicators of how healthy the community is. What’s the point of posts that no-one reads? the platform encourages and tracks reading habits so community managers can keep a healthy balance.Click a topic title and read down the list of replies in chronological order, following links or previewing replies and quotes as you go.

Sometimes conversations are clearer if topics are split, where posts are moved to a more appropriate topic, or two related topics are merged.

You can continue reading (and even search or navigate to different topics) while you compose your reply.All posts are shown in the order they are published.

If you minimise the editor or navigate to a different topic, the editor might disappear.

I have tried the tutorial on FireFox 95.0.2, 64-bit and I think the code snippets have new lines, but I have not tried to compile or use. Some of the code lines are really long, but look the same as in Chrome, Edge and FF.Please let us know if this is still an issue , its possible the other team has fixed it but didn’t tell us. If its still an issue we can escalate.
Thanks for raising this.Hi,
Just checked back with the FF Version 96.0.1 (64-bit), the issue persist.
The code lines not just long, they are missing new lines.
This would be compilable if they contain the code only, C++ not strict to new lines, but they use C++ single line comments which make all the code of the following lines treated as comments. And, of course, they are not readable.If you line, I can make a screenshot showing how I see it it the browser.Thanks for paying attention and for your time.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

I noticed there is a pinned thread told users should send their ~/.nvsdkm by PM:
Read this topic for SDK Manager Issues:please package the folder ~/.nvsdkm and send that to me via a private messageI don’t believe people will follow this tip. Because you must read above thread firstly, and it’s weird to report issues in public but attach log by PM.To confirm my guess. I searched forum by nvsdkm and open top 10 of them just now, and found 8/10 sent in public.Obviously sdkm log are helpfull to trace issue. And most of user don’t follow tips in above thread actually. So it’s hard to ask people do some additinal actions if the harm isn’t obvious.So if something in ~/.nvsdkm shouldn’t be shared in public, then SDK Manager is the one should be changed, not the users.Hi,I posted that statement so that I could personally make sure the user issue was going to be resolved. I am not sure what the problem is here.@TomNVIDIA ,
The point is why need to send SDKM log by Private Message? Is there any security issue if share in public like most of people doing now?If you send the log to me as a private message, I am more likely to respond quickly. I get over 500+ forum post notifications daily, making it harder to respond in a timely manner when a user just posts the info.

The message “You have exhausted the lab time provided with your course enrollment.” appeared. I cannot spend my time doing the lab until the end.

Though, I’ve seen some edits from NVIDIA people not being logged.
I’m sure I haven’t added these tags by myself.Might I expect to get one day an answer to this legitimate question. What do these tags do ?Hope you’ll find some time for this.BTW, it gets very boring to have to classify images for NVIDIA in order to log in. Today, I have had to classify more than 3 batches, despite I was trying to get the right class for each. Very annoying from a user point of view.Best regards,
HPHi HP,Sorry for the delay in responding, this one slipped through the cracks.
I reached out to the vendor, and here is their response.Those attributes are added by Discourse when it processes the raw content of posts. The purpose of rel=“nofollow noopener” is to prevent tabnabbing when links are set to open in a new tab. Discourse parses the post’s raw text. If it finds a link with the target=""_blank"" attribute, it adds the rel=""noopener"" attribute.You can get more info here:  About rel=noopener . Discourse also implements a javascript fix to prevent tabnabbing issues. This is done to prevent tabnabbing on browsers that don’t support noopener .emphasized textRegarding the CAPTCHA at login, this is part of the company SSO, and is not controlled at the forum level. Note, that I have shared your feedback with the team for consideration in future updates.Cheers,
TomThanks Tom for the answer. Not sure why some of my posts got this target=""_blank"" attribute, let’s say it was in first days of discourse forum software.About the captcha, I’ve just found that zooming in my browser the images are much more easy to classify (I’m using UWHD monitor with 3440x1440 resolution and with Firefox without zoom images are just like post stamps).Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

135,how-to-remove-all-packages-installed-by-sdk-manager-and-then-remove-sdk-manager-itself,"Hi,
My ENV firstly: DRIVE OS 6.0.4 / Linux / p3710-10-s05, 940-63710-0010-D00 / SDKM 1.8.3.10426 / Ubuntu 20.04.5There’re 2 pinned thread talking about uninstalling SDK Manager:
In Nsight Perf SDK, Uninstall Nvidia SDK manager
And in Jetson Xavier, Uninstall or delete the SDK managerThese uninstall commands/methods should be documented in Official SDK Manager Doc: NVIDIA SDK Manager DocumentationFor my situation, I want to back to the place before using SDK Manager. There are three issues:Thanks!Hi @KeelungI have forwarded your questions to the SDKM team for review.Thanks,
TomHi @KeelungEngineering for the SDKM provided the following instructions.1.      I install SDK Manager by double clicking, and then it’s shown in Ubuntu Software. But why I can’t find it in Ubuntu Software after installing?
I can find SDK Manager in Ubuntu Software Center after installing. It is listed under Ubuntu Software Center → Installed → Add-ons.
2.      Seems SDK Manager doesn’t remember packages installed by itself, then how can I remove all packages installed by SDK Manager and then remove SDK Manager itself?
SDK Manager does remember packages installed by itself. It has the database to record all the installed packages.
There are separate chapters in SDK Manager user guide describing how to remove different SDKs installed by SDK Manager. e.g. for Jetson users, they can refer to below user guide to remove the installed packages inside “Manage NVIDIA SDKs” page.
Install Jetson Software with SDK Manager :: NVIDIA SDK Manager Documentation
To remove SDK Manager client itself:
To uninstall SDK Manager on Linux, you should use your package manager’s uninstall or remove option. The exact command line will differ depending on which package manager you used.
For example on Ubuntu OSes
# sudo apt-get remove sdkmanager
3.      Is there a plan to update SDK Manager by apt update && apt upgrade?
SDK Manager client supports to auto update itself. After login, the user will see an update message pop up when a newer SDK Manager version is available to use.
The user can also click on the three dots in the top right corner (“⋮”) → select Settings → “Check for updates…” to see available updates.
“Add SDK Manager to NVIDA apt repository” is included in SDK Manager next year’s roadmap, but no specific commitment date yet.Let me know if you have any questions.Regards,
Tom KHi @TomNVIDIA ,
SDK Manager 1.6.4 is not listed in my Add-ons.It is listed under Ubuntu Software Center → Installed → Add-ons.Hi @Keelung,I have sent this to the SDKM team for review.Thanks,

138,nvidia-now-rocket-league-development,"Hello!
I’m writing this topic not as myself, but instead as the general gaming population of Nvidia Now users, who play rocket league. Epic Games just joined in on the modding development of Rocket League along with Steam who has been involved for many many years.Inside Rocket League with steam, there has been a training mod known as Bakkesmod for many years. Bakkesmod itself has a full development team behind it, constantly updating and tweaking it to perfection.As of today, Epic Games and Bakkesmod have released an Epic Games version that allows users to now use Bakkesmod without having to own the game through steam, which is no longer possible since the Free-to-Play Update released, removing Rocket League(RL) from Steam. So, if you didn’t already have RL on Steam before the update, you could no longer get it, and therefore use Bakkesmod. Until ofcourse, the update today.Nvidia Now supports both Steam and Epic Games versions of RL. This being said, it isn’t possible to use Bakkesmod on neither version through Nvidia Now.Bakkesmod is a very important part of the game. Pros use it. New comers use it. & everyone in between, which is why Epic Games worked with the dev team behind Bakkesmod to get it inside the game.I have spoken with the Epic Games(EG) dev team, the Bakkesmod(BM) dev team, and on a forum, hundreds of Nvidia Now users who are upset that the others in the RL community have an advantage over us, with Bakkesmods’ support.EG devs and BM devs have the same thing to say about using BM with Nvidia Now.“In order to have bakkesmod support within Nvidia Now, they would need to install BM on their own computers, as Nvidia Now is a streaming service, within which you are running the game on their computer.”We’re begging, work with Bakkesmod and Epic Games to bring FULL Bakkesmod support. BM makes the game more enjoyable, while significantly providing better training and improvement to your gameplay than you would have without it.If whoever reads this is unsure of anything I’m talking about, Bakkesmod has a Discord where the Devs talk to users, you can simply search it online. (Alpha Console).Lastly, you can google anything I’ve mentioned and you will be brought up to many many forums and questions and users who can prove my request true as an need in the community.Thank you.Hello,Welcome to the Nvidia Developer Forums.

Indeed, Ubuntu 1804 ships with kernel 4.15, and currently, kernel 4.19 is the most recent. According error message, I needed 4.16 at least, so, playing it save, I loaded 4.16 and rebooted.  Everything’s great except that now I don’t have a second display.  Error message this time, suggests that the driver is the culprit.  So, I upgraded to 410. That didn’t help.  So, I went back to 396. That didn’t work either, so it’s back to 390, which I know won’t work with the latest Tensorflow that I just compiled, but at least I’ll have the second display back.  Wrong!!To make a long story short, I’ve been messing around with it, on and off, for almost 2 days and with it back to the original combination (driver 390, Kernel 4.15 and Cuda 9.1) I’m still limping along with the single laptop display and because I’ve gone back, I can’t run Tensorflow either.I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this, oh, and if whoever that may be, has suffered through it long enough to have found the fix??Very few people will see this post in this area.

Hi Keelung,The target install need internet access anyway. Because we need install additional packages on it.
For the network performance issue in China, do you mean “apt update” and installation of other packages from Ubuntu repository takes long time?
If true, you might consider to switch to repository mirrors located in China. The mirror list is available atUbuntu also includes a wide variety of software through its network of software repositories. Once your system is installed you can simply call up a list of all the existing tools out there and choose any of them for immediate installation over the...
You could update the mirror by replacing urls in /etc/apt/sources.list file.If you have performance issue with downloading from repo.download.nvidia.com, you could disable the repository by commenting the lines in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-l4t-apt-source.list .Hi EdwardZhou,

However, as the packages are nvidia specific and should come from repo.download.nvidia.com.

You could enable it after installing JetPack.

Anyway, this is annoying, and I thought you’d want to look into this and improve the server’s behavior.
Thanks.Seconded. Using Chromium here, and this behaviour is increasingly putting me off.Yeah same thing happens if I get a link to the Forum in an email for a topic I am following.  Best you can do it copy the page url quickly and post it in a new Chrome or Chromium page.This is a serious pain in the ass, hard to work on issues when you are fighting the Forum itself.This has been happening to me for months, why in the world has this not been fixed yet???@sisso_, This happens when you are not logged in beforehand, then logging in takes you to the home page. It is a known issue with this platform and will be addressed on the next site update.Best,

TomSince you live and breathe in here: when are we finally getting an updated statement regarding macOS Mojave / Catalina drivers?This statement is simply false and outdated: https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1043070/announcements/faq-about-macos-10-14-mojave-nvidia-drivers/“Apple fully controls drivers for Mac OS. Unfortunately, NVIDIA currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved by Apple.”Apple does not need to sign and therefore approve any drivers to make them work. You can do all the work on your own. The Metal 2 API and all the necessary hardware and software specifications are part of Apples Developer Program. Some crucial parts of the driver level of Catalina even have been made open source. Your team could release the current state of the drivers to the public and make beta tests without any saying from Apple - that’s what the Developer Betas of Catalina are for.(And sorry for hijacking this thread - if you would actually read the other thread that’s exploding: https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1042520/drivers/-when-will-the-nvidia-web-drivers-be-released-for-macos-mojave-10-14-/87 or would allow comments on the thread above, I would’ve made my post there. But sadly, this issue is about to celebrate it’s first anniversary soon and there is no end in sight, but it’s about time.@grunerd,I am just the community manager here in Devtalk. Any comments on drivers would have to come from someone above me.I am sure you can understand.Best,
Tom@grunerd,I am just the community manager here in Devtalk. Any comments on drivers would have to come from someone above me.I am sure you can understand.Best,
TomBut as a community manager, wouldn’t it have been your job to annoy every single human being above you that there is a thread with hundreds of people rioting because none of the people above you finally managed to give an updated (and valid) statement regarding the current situation? Hm? NOTHING has happened for months. But it’s about time!I may be mistaken but I think Apple writes the Nvidia drivers for Mac OS because reasons… Unless something major has changed recently. You might consider asking on an apple forum.Yes, the forum interface is so brilliant, that you have to click STOP button to avoid it to skip to another page.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

Avid user of Iray for 3ds max as a tool for lighting design at work and in school.
Why is there not an option to produce false color images with luminance calculations?
It’s possible to get illuminance calculations. Seems like Luminance calculations should be possible but there is no option for it.
Is this being developed?

179,feature-request-using-geforce-forums-color-scheme,"As far as I understand GeForce forums and NVIDIA devtalk forums have the same engine, so I’m curious if it’s possible to use GeForce forums color scheme here.Hi Artem,Nvidia chose to make the two forums look completely different on purpose. Also, the Grid forum (Virtual GPU) has the same look as Devtalk. Devtalk users might be happy to hear that we are looking at a total redesign of the Devtalk forums coming sometime in 2019.Best,
TomI’m ok with current design, but I have to say that the green color of links to attachments on grey background makes these almost unreadable to me.Hi HP,As a quick fix, I actually have a ticket open to increase the font size of the attachment links. I will update here when the change has been made.Thanks,
TomHi Tom,Thanks for the quick workaround proposal.
Seems to my eyes that it becomes easily readable with 130% zoom, but probably changing font or background color would be better.
Probably a darker grey background would lead to better contrast.I’m ok with either theme, but picked the lighter theme because for me increased brightness adds to ability to read up close. The brightness on the sides/borders causes the pupils to constrict and increases the depth of focus (I have a separate set of glasses for reading versus driving).On the other hand, I do find a lot about the darker theme I like within the center column where threads are shown (the inner content, not the outer borders). If not for the outer border darkness in the GeForce forums I’d prefer that.A good design allows separating theme from layout so the user can pick a theme, but that’s a lot more work to implement well. If looking at software which already has the choice of picking a color theme which is customizable I’d consider that a plus. If not, I wouldn’t consider it worth waiting for.Hello,The platform vendor just pushed a change to production that increased the font size and changed the background to white.External MediaLooks great, however it would be even better if you showed the Unicode paperclip symbol before the attachment name.Hi Artem,That is another issue altogether. It is on my long list of things that need to be addressed in 2019.Thanks,
TomLooks much better to me :-)
Thanks Tom.Thanks @Honey_Patouceul!@Linuxdev, thanks for the feedback.As I mentioned before, we will be doing a redesign in early 2019.
I promise you all a better user experience.Cheers,

The problem with some code sample is that it might not be formatted to be interpreted as code.Text can be formatted to be interpreted as code either by indenting it with 4 spaces or by wrapping the code between lines that contain three backticks ```.The platform will attempt to find the correct code language for the code, but to ensure that the correct language highlighting is used, users can add the language after the opening three backticks.

This should also reduce the amount of duplicated effort (e.g. cross-posts between various places) as well as noise that NVIDIA developers have to sift through (the more noise, the less likely to visit or engage).As some examples, threads that I was under the impression kind of belonged here (though that might be clarified):And some examples that should have just been directed towards other support routes:Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

tf.contrib.training.bucket_by_sequence_lengthUsing that function allows one to stratify minibatches into groups (“buckets”) and if you use dynamic_pad=True, the minibatches will group similarly sized sequences for efficient training via dynamic_rnn. However, there aren’t many examples on how to use this function and the only examples regarding LSTM RNN is related to text sequences and it’s univariate. There’s no numerical streaming data with more than one feature examples?Very few people will see this question in the “forum feedback” area. Try posting the same question here instead:

Thanks for your patience.TomHi Alexandra. Can you please share what you are seeing? What specific error are you getting?FredWhen I enter the username and password the following error appears: Incorrect email or password.
I am confident that the credentials are correct because I successfully login to this website.I also tried with a different Nvidia account, but the same problem persists.Can you please verify that in SDK Manager, you are logging in through “NVIDIA DEVELOPER” tab and not “NVONLINE” tab?Yes absolutely, I’m definitely trying to login via the Nvidia Developer tab.Hi Alexandra, can you package and upload the ~/.nvsdkm folder  for further investigation?In addition, are you behind a proxy server?Yes corporate proxy serverWould you have any advice for dealing with the proxy server (eg accessing the program from terminal)? Would it be possible to download the SDK on a Windows PC and transfer it to the Linux for installation? Sorry I’m very new to this.Hi Alexandra,
There is an issue when login via proxy, we are working on a fix for the issue. Will post you when the new build of SDK Manager client is ready.Hi,
Could you download the lastest sdkm build 1.2.0.6738 from NVIDIA SDK Manager | NVIDIA Developer, and check if it resolves your issue?Thanks,
ChangbinThank you for releasing a new sdk manager.
Unfortunately, I am receiving the message ‘Unable to connect. Check your internet / proxy settings’It works now.
From command line, I circumvented the proxy ‘export http_proxy=’
Thanks for your help!Glad to see the issue is now resolved:)Hi NVIDIA,
Thank you for your assistance.
There still remains one issue.
When I attempt to flash the target hardware (Jetson TX2), the installation fails due to ‘VPI on Host: Failed to query debian packages details (host)’.
Is this an issue with the proxy server?Hi @alexandra.tran,Please start a new topic in the Jetson forum, as this section is not monitored by support staff.Discussions relating to the Jetson DevKits and other Embedded computing devicesThanks,

276,cant-reply-to-issues-after-a-couple-of-weeks,"This topic was automatically closed 14 days after the last reply. New replies are no longer allowed.It’s a frustrating feature to close a discussion entirely. Now I’m forced to create a new post with no context instead of continuing the relevant conversation and the participants of the original conversation are unlikely to be notified.  Compared to Stack Exchange sites, these NVIDIA forums are terrible.  This is a great way to ensure the community doesn’t participate in discussion.  I can’t help someone with a solution to a problem they were having and am blocked from leaving a relevant answer in the appropriate thread/topic.Hello @wyckster ,Thanks for the feedback. We strive to make our forums the best possible. We have tested the closing of topics with with a longer timespan, but found too many folks were jumping into existing conversations with new issues. Fourteen days seemed to be the sweet spot, yet some topics may still need a longer open time. I can reopen a topic if you can please share the link to the topic that was closed?Thanks,
