Whether companies are manufacturing semiconductor chips, airplanes, automobiles, smartphones, or food or beverages, quality and throughput are key benefits of optimization. Poor quality and throughput can result in significant operational, financial, and reputational costs. Deep learning-based computer vision technology enables manufacturers to perform automated visual inspection. Compared to traditional visual inspection processes—which are often manual and rules-based—visual inspection AI can improve efficiency, reduce operating costs, and deliver more consistent results.In this Deep Learning Institute (DLI) workshop, developers will learn how to create an end-to-end hardware-accelerated industrial inspection pipeline to automate defect detection. Using NVIDIA’s own real production data set as an example, we’ll illustrate how the application can be easily applied to a variety of manufacturing use cases. Developers will also learn to identify and mitigate common pitfalls in deep learning-based computer vision tasks, and be able to deploy and measure the effectiveness of their AI solution.All workshop attendees get access to fully configured, GPU-accelerated servers in the cloud, guidance from a DLI certified instructor, and the opportunity to network with other developers, data scientists, and researchers attending the workshop. Attendees can also earn a certificate to prove subject matter competency and support professional growth.

23,temperature-rtx-3080-cards,"Hi,We have a project made of 26 PCs, each of them driving 2x RTX 3080 cards (so 52x RTX3080 cards total). The 3080 cards rely on a turbo fan design (gigabyte).The end user has reported an issue where the rear panel of the PC cases are extremely hot. The PCs are rack-mounted in a proper server room (cooling etc.).The GPU temperature reported by nvapi is 88°C under standard load (can reach 89°C temporarily sometimes, but mostly steady at 88°C). This looks a bit high in my eyes, however, our hardware provider told us 88°C is the normal operation temperature of the serie 3000 cards, before throttling occurs.Is that correct ?Thanks a lot for your prompt answer.Regards,
Gregory JaegyHi there @gjaegy and welcome to the NVIDIA developer forums!Do you know nvidia-smi? Try out this command:This is for an RTX 3080 that I am using, Windows 11. But nvidia-smi is also installed on Linux systems if you are using NVIDIA drivers.So yes, 88C is still totally ok. Especially given the non-spec setup you are using. GeForce GPUs are not designed for Server setups in rack-mounted cases. Regardless of the fan setup. I am not surprised that the rear exhaust area is getting hot, since in a typical rack design the outlet fans or openings are pretty small.I hope this helps!Hi Mark,Thanks for your useful answer.I’m not familiar with that tool. Looking on the dedicated webpage it seems to support professional cards only, not GeForce cards, is the webpage outdated/wrong?You are welcome.The tool supports any NVIDIA GPU which is running with supported NVIDIA drivers. The comment about professional cards is mostly with respect to some advanced features that might not be available on GeForce consumer cards.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

It’s important to have a diverse set of images, including images with pencils in different locations and orientations. Then you can use this dataset to train a CNN.You can use pre-trained models such as VGG, Resnet, Inception etc as a base model, and then fine-tune the model on your dataset. This can be done by using transfer learning approach, where you’ll be using the weights of pre-trained models and fine-tune them on your dataset.Then, you can use this trained model to classify new images as containing a pencil or not, and use the output of the model to locate the pencil in the image. This can be done by using techniques such as bounding box regression or object detection algorithms such as YOLO, SSD etc.It’s also important to note that training a neural network requires a lot of computational resources and time. You may consider using cloud-based services such as AWS or GCP to train your models.Additionally, you can also consider using pre-built libraries such as Tensorflow, Pytorch, or OpenCV which have built-in functionality for image classification and object detection which can make your task easier.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"

The Austrian localised page for GeForce Experience (Aktualisiere Treiber und optimiere Spieleinstellungen)
serves a very outdated version of GeForce Experience - the download button links to GeForce_Experience_v3.20.5.70.exe which is 3 years old!!This version is too old to update itself and also fails every time when you try to install the graphics driver … I just found out only by comparing the version numbers with the German page (de-de).Could you please fix that?ThanksHello,Welcome to the NVIDIA Developer forums!

41,nvidia-hlrs-sciml-gpu-bootcamp,"Digital EventOctober 24 - 25, 2022Application Deadline: October 5, 2022Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized the way of performing classification, pattern recognition, and regression tasks in various application areas. Scientific applications solving linear and non-linear equations with demanding accuracy and computational performance requirements can use a class of DL networks, called Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). In fact, PINNs are specifically designed to integrate scientific computing equations, such as Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), Partial Differential Equations (PDE), non-linear and integral-differential equations into the DL network training. This workshop introduce Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) with PINN and hands-on experience with a PDE solver NVIDIA Modulus, a neural network framework that blends the power of physics in the form of governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with data to build high-fidelity, parameterized surrogate models with near-real-time latency. This online Bootcamp is a hands-on learning experience where you will be guided through step-by-step instructions with teaching assistants on hand to help throughout.The Bootcamp is co-organized by HLRS, LRZ, OpenACC.org and NVIDIA for EuroCC@GCS, the German National Competence Centre for High-Performance Computing.Event FormatThis 2-day Bootcamp will be hosted online in the Central European Summer Time (CEST) zone. All communication will be done through Zoom, Slack and email.PrerequisitesGPU Compute ResourcesPersons attending the event will be given access to the GPU cluster for the duration of the Bootcamp.APPLY NOWPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled"
