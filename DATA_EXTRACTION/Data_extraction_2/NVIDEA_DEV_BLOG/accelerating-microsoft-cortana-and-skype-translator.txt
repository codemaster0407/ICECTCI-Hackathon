Alexey Kamenev, Software Engineer at Microsoft Research talks about their open-source Computational Network Toolkit (CNTK) for deep learning, which describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. Kamenev also shares a bit about how they’re using GPUs, the CUDA Toolkit and GPU-accelerated libraries for the variety of Microsoft products that benefit from deep learning, such as speech recognition for Skype Translator and Cortana.
“Basically, right now the whole world of deep learning is using GPUs and Microsoft is not an exception,” said Alexey.
