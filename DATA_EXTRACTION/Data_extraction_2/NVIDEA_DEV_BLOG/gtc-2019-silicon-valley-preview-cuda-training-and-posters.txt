Expected to be the biggest yet, NVIDIA’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC 2019) features hundreds of sessions on the most important topics in computing today. At GTC, NVIDIA DLI offers an array of self-paced courses and instructor-led workshops for developers, data scientists, and researchers looking to solve the world’s most challenging problems with accelerated computing. Get hands-on training on accelerating applications using CUDA C/C++ and CUDA Python, accelerating data science workflows using RAPIDS, executing CUDA code on DRIVE AGX, and more:While at GTC, also check out over 150 research posters and mingle with their brilliant authors to see how big ideas are accelerated through the power of GPUs. Here is a glimpse into some of the CUDA-related posters in topics ranging from HPC and AI to computational physics and quantitative risk management.If you want to gain insights from experts into updates to the CUDA platform and cutting-edge applications it has fueled across industries and scientific domains, make sure to check out these can’t miss talks and ‘Connect with the Experts’ sessions.Explore all CUDA Sessions and Sign up now to secure your spot at GTC.“At the core of all of the GTC activities are NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA SDK that helps researchers, enterprises, and others to maximize the processing potential of their GPUs. Without CUDA, it is all just hardware that looks green and pretty. GTC is fundamentally about enabling the developers that utilize the NVIDIA CUDA SDK to connect with one another and others in the ecosystem to advance their learning and skills.” – Patrick Moorhead
