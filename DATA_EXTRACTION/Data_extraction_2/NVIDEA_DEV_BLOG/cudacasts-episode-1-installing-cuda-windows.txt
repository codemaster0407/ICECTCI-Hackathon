Today I’m excited to announce CUDACasts, a brand new series of short, useful screencast videos about parallel programming on the CUDA platform. I’ll be bringing you new CUDACasts every week covering topics including step-by-step beginner how-tos, programming techniques and CUDA Pro Tips, and overviews of new CUDA features and tools.CUDACasts Episode #1 gives an introduction to CUDACasts and the CUDA Platform, and shows you how to install the CUDA Toolkit on a Windows computer.
Each week, you’ll be able to find new CUDACasts here at the Developer Blog, or on YouTube. Next week on CUDACasts, I’ll show you how to write your first CUDA Program.
