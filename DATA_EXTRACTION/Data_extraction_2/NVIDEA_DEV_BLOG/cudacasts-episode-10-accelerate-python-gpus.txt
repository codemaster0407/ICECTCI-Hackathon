This week’s CUDACast continues the Parallel Forall Python theme kicked off in last week’s post by Mark Harris, demonstrating exciting new support for CUDA acceleration in Python with NumbaPro. This video is the first in a 3-part series showing various ways to accelerate your Python code on NVIDIA GPUs.Tomorrow you won’t want to miss the chance to learn about Python GPU acceleration with NumbaPro from its creators, in a GTC Express Webinar called “Pythonic Parallel Patterns for the GPU with NumbaPro” from Siu Kwan Lam, NumbaPro’s primary author at Continuum Analytics.
