Erik Lindahl, Professor of Biophysics at Stockholm University, talks about using the GPU-accelerated GROMACS application to simulate protein dynamics. This approach helps researchers learn how to design better drugs, combat alcoholism and understand how certain diseases occur.
Lindahl mentions they started using CUDA in their work nearly five years ago and now 90% of their computational resources are GPUs. “It’s everything we do.”
