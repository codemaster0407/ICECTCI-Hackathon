NVIDIA announces the newest release of the CUDA development environment, CUDA 11.6. This release is focused on enhancing the programming model and performance of your CUDA applications. CUDA continues to push the boundaries of GPU acceleration and lay the foundation for new applications in HPC, visualization, AI, ML and DL, and data science.CUDA 11.6 has several important features. This post offers an overview of the key capabilities:CUDA 11.6 ships with the R510 driver, an update branch. CUDA 11.6 Toolkit is available to download.The GSP driver architecture is now the default driver mode for all listed Turing and Ampere GPUs. The older driver architecture is supported as a fallback. For more information, see R510 Driver Readme.We added a new API, cudaGraphNodeSetEnabled, to allow disabling nodes in an instantiated graph. Support is limited to kernel nodes in this release.  A corresponding API, cudaGraphNodeGetEnabled, allows querying the enabled state of a node. We’ve also added the ability to disable NULL kernel graph node launches.CUDA 11.6 includes the full release of 128-bit integer (__int128) data type, including compiler and developer tools support. The host-side compiler must support the __int128 type to use this feature.The cooperative groups namespace has been updated with new functions to improve consistency in naming, function scope, and unit dimension and size.
