We published nearly 100 technical blogs this year on the NVIDIA Developer Blog to help developers across a variety of industries develop their GPU-accelerated applications and the site had millions of page views. Below is a list of the most viewed posts from 2019 and some that you might have missed.    Thank you to all the developers that continue to educate themselves by reading posts on the NVIDIA Developer Blog to increase your technical knowledge of products from NVIDIA and our partners.
