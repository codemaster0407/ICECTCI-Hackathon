GPUs have proven to be incredibly effective at solving some of the most complex problems in deep learning, and while the NVIDIA deep learning platform is the standard industry solution for training, its inferencing capability is not as widely understood. Some of the world’s leading enterprises from the data center to the edge have built their inferencing solution on NVIDIA GPUs. Some examples include:
