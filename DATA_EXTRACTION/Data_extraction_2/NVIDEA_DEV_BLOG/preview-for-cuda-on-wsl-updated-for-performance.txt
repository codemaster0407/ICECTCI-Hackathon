Recently, Microsoft announced their public preview program for their Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) capability on Microsoft Windows platforms. NVIDIA co-released GPU-accelerated support via CUDA on WSL, where AI frameworks run as Linux executables on Microsoft Windows platforms. We are happy to announce the release of the latest version of the preview driver with enhancements that will improve the experience for CUDA WSL users and enable more of the native CUDA features on WSL: Features planned in upcoming releases: Interested participants can register in both the NVIDIA Developer Program and the Microsoft Windows Insider Program to access driver installers and documentation via the Downloads area on our CUDA on WSL webpage. Developers can use our Forum for sharing their public preview feedback with the WSL community.Leverage our developer blog, CUDA on Windows Subsystem for Linux, to learn much more about how CUDA works with WSL, including how to get started with running applications, including deep learning containers.
