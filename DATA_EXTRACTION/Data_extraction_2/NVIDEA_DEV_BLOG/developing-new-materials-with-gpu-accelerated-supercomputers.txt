Research Area Specialist Dr. Joshua A. Anderson at University of Michigan was an early user of GPU computing technology. He began his career developing software on the first CUDA capable GPU, and now runs simulations on one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.
His “contributions to the development and dissemination of the open source, GPU-enabled molecular simulation software, HOOMD-blue, which enables scientific computations with unprecedented speed” earned him the 2015 CoMSEF Young Investigator Award for Modeling and Simulation.
A simulation of a microsphere formed from star polymers. It is the largest research-producing simulation to date using HOOMD, at 11 million particles. Zhang, et. al. (2015) Simultaneous Nano- and Microscale Control of Nanofibrous Microspheres Self-Assembled from Star-Shaped Polymers 27, 3947–3952 (doi: 10.1002/adma.201570177).
Anderson is part of the Glotzer Group where they use computer simulations to discover the fundamental principles of how nanoscale systems of building blocks self-assemble, and to discover how to control the assembly process to engineer new materials. Specifically, they focus on the role of particle shape and how changing the shape can result in different material properties.
