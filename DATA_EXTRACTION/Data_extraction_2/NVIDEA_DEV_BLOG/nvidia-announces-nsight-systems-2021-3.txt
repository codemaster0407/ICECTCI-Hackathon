User workflows are improved with both the introduction of the Expert System View which identifies problematic patterns, as well as the new ability to load multiple reports into the same timeline to investigate multi-process issues with greater ease. Nsight Systems now supports Windows 21H1 SDK, sample GPU PCIe BAR1 request activity, trace UCX asynchronous API calls, and trace Vulkan QueueSubmit or Direct3D12 ExecuteCommandList GPU workloads as a reduced overhead option.Nsight Systems is part of a larger family of Nsight tools. A developer can start with Nsight Systems to see the big picture and avoid picking less efficient optimizations based on assumptions and false-positive indicators.
