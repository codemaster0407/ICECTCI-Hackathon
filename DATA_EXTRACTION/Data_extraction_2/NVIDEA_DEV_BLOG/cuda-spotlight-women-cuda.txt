Today we are pleased to launch the new Women and CUDA website.We received a wide variety of entries from around the world, representing professors, students, researchers, scientists and domain experts. We had recognized several participants earlier as CUDA Spotlights, including Valerie Halyo of Princeton and Monica Syal of Advanced Rotorcraft Technology.CUDA Fellow Lorena Barba comments: “This is a good way to remind people that women write code, participate in open-source projects, and invent things. It’s important to make the technology world more attractive to female students.” Dr. Barba is an associate professor of Engineering and Applied Science at George Washington University.Congrats to the women on our inaugural Women and CUDA list:Sonia Lopez Alarcon, Rochester Institute of Technology | Heterogeneous Computing
