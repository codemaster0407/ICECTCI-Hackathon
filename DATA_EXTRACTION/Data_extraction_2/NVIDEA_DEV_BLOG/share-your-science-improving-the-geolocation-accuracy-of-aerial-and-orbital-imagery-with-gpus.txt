Devin White, Senior Researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory shares how they are using GPUs to improve the geolocation accuracy of imagery collected by a satellite, manned aircraft, or an unmanned aerial system.
Using Tesla K80 GPUs and CUDA, the researchers in the Geographic Information Science and Technology Group at ORNL developed a sensor-agnostic, plugin-based framework to support photogrammetric and computer vision processing tasks like image registration and orthorectification.
