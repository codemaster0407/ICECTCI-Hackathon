Zhili Chen, a 3D Graphics Researcher from Adobe Research, shares how they are using TITAN X GPUs and CUDA to create a real-time painting system that simulates the interactions between brush, paint, and canvas at the bristle level.
He describes how artists can use the system to draw realistic and vivid digital paintings, by applying the painting techniques they are familiar with, in a virtual environment.

For more details, read Zhili’s research paper ‘Wetbrush: GPU-based 3D Painting Simulation at the Bristle Level’.
