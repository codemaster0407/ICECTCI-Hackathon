Visual tools offer a very efficient method for developing and debugging applications. When working on massively parallel codes built on the CUDA Platform, this visual approach is even more important because you could be dealing with tens of thousands of parallel threads.With the free NVIDIA Nsight Eclipse Edition IDE, you can quickly and easily examine the GPU memory state in a running CUDA C or C++ application. In today’s CUDACast, we continue our CUDA 5.5 series with a look at this new feature available to Eclipse users.In the next few weeks, we’ll take a break from the CUDA 5.5 new feature series and explore some other topics, such as writing CUDA applications in pure Python. Stay tuned!To request a topic for a future episode of CUDACasts, or if you have any other feedback, please leave a comment to let us know.
