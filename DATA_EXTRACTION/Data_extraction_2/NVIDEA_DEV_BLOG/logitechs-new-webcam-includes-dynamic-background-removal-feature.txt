Announced at TwitchCon in San Diego, Logitech introduced their newest webcam designed to meet the needs for serious streamers.
“With the C922 Pro Stream Webcam, we are taking game casting to the next level so you can easily broadcast your gameplay like a pro, better engage with your community, and stand out from the crowd,” said Guillaume Bourelly, portfolio and product manager of webcams at Logitech.
The most important new feature of the webcam is its deep learning-based dynamic background replacement software that lets users change their scenery while broadcasting live or on Skype and WebEx – instead of needing a costly green screen.
Powered by Personify’s new ChromoCam technology, the “intelligent shape recognition” software was developed using TITAN X GPUs, CUDA and the cuDNN-accelerated Caffe deep learning framework – which is able to identify the user and automatically cuts the human from the background.

Personify also launched a new GPU-accelerated product called Fusion—the world’s first truly immersive multi-person video calling experience that teleports you and your friends onto your desktop using their dynamic green screen technology. Play video games together, watch a movie, or experience live sports as if you are in the same room together.
