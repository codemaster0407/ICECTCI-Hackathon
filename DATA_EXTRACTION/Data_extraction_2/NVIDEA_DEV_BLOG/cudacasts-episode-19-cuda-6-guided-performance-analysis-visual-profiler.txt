One of the main reasons for accelerating code on an NVIDIA GPU is for an increase in application performance. This is why it’s important to use the best tools available to help you get the performance you’re looking for. CUDA 6 includes great improvements to the guided analysis tool in the NVIDIA Visual Profiler. Watch today’s CUDACast to see how to use guided analysis to locate potential optimizations for your GPU code.You can find the code used in this video in the CUDACasts GitHub repository.To suggest a topic for a future episode of CUDACasts, or if you have any other feedback, please leave a comment below.
