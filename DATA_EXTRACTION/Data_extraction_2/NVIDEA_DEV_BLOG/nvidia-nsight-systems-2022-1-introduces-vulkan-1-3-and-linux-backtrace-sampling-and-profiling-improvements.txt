The latest update to NVIDIA Nsight Systems—a performance analysis tool designed to help developers tune and scale software across CPUs and GPUs—is now available for download. Nsight Systems 2022.1 introduces several improvements aimed to enhance the profiling experience. Nsight Systems is part of the powerful debugging and profiling NVIDIA Nsight Tools Suite. A developer can start with Nsight Systems for an overall system view and avoid picking less efficient optimizations based on assumptions and false-positive indicators. With Vulkan 1.3, you now have access to nearly two dozen new extensions. Some extensions, like VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering, help you to simplify your code while improving readability.Other extensions, such as VK_KHR_shader_integer_dot_product or VK_EXT_pipeline_creation_cache_control, provide new functionality to help you build even better graphics applications. This release of Nsight Systems includes support for Vulkan 1.3 that helps you solve real world problems quickly and easily.The system-wide CPU thread context switch trace and backtrace sampling feature on Linux. Users will now be able to see if other apps, OS processes and kernel might be interfering with the processes you are profiling.
