Training for SuccessContinuing its popular public workshop series, the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) released the schedule for June, July, and August of 2021. These workshops are conducted live in a virtual classroom environment with expert guidance from NVIDIA-certified instructors. Participants have access to fully configured GPU-accelerated servers in the cloud to perform hands-on exercises. Learning new and advanced software development skills is vital to staying ahead in a competitive job market. DLI offers a comprehensive learning experience on a wide range of important topics in AI, data science, and accelerated computing. Gain hands-on experience with the most widely used, industry-standard software, tools, and frameworks. Successful completion of the course and assessment earns an NVIDIA certificate of competency.Among the workshops scheduled are two new courses: Accelerating Data Engineering Pipelines and Building Conversational AI Applications. To register, visit our website.
