NVIDIA announced the NVIDIA Metropolis intelligent video analytics platform today at the GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in San Jose, CA.
Metropolis makes cities safer and smarter by applying deep learning to video streams for applications such as public safety, traffic management and resource optimization. More than 50 NVIDIA AI city partner companies are already providing products and applications that use deep learning on GPUs, many of which will be on display this week at this week’s GTC.“Deep learning is enabling powerful intelligent video analytics that turn anonymized video into real-time valuable insights, enhancing safety and improving lives,” said Deepu Talla, vice president and general manager of the Tegra business at NVIDIA. “The NVIDIA Metropolis platform enables customers to put AI behind every video stream to create smarter cities.”
Metropolis spans multiple NVIDIA products that operate on a unified architecture.
High-performance deep learning inferencing happens at the edge with the NVIDIA Jetson embedded computing platform, and through servers and data centers with NVIDIA Tesla GPU accelerators. Rich data visualization is powered by NVIDIA Quadro professional graphics. And the entire edge-to-cloud platform is supported by rich NVIDIA software development kits, including JetPack, DeepStream and TensorRT.
See how the NVIDIA Metropolis platform is transforming public safety and AI cities at GTC 2017 through May 11 at the San Jose Convention Center.
