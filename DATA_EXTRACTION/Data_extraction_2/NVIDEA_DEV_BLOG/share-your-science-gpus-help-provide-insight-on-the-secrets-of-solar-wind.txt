Shahab Fatemi, PhD Fellow at the University of California Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, shares how his team is using CUDA, TITAN X and Tesla K80 GPUs to develop a three-dimensional plasma model that can provide a better understanding of how solar wind could affect Earth.  
“GPUs have been revolutionary in space and plasma physics modeling,” said Fatemi. “You can today, tackle the problems that seemed to be computationally too expensive to be solved two to three years ago.”
Fatemi and his colleagues are also using the GPU-accelerated model to explore the interior electrical conductivity of the moon, which he says can better identify the moon’s composition and determine if it is indeed similar to Earth.
