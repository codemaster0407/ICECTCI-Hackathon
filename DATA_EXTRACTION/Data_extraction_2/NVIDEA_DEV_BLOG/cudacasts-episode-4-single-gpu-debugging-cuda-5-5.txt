Even if you’ve already watched CUDACasts episode 3 on creating your first OpenACC program, you’ll want to go watch the new version which includes a clearer, animated introduction. So check it out!In the next few CUDACasts we’ll be exploring some of the new features available in CUDA 5.5, which is available as a release candidate now and will be officially released very soon. Episode 4 kicks it off by demonstrating single-GPU debugging using Nsight Eclipse Edition on Linux. With this feature, it is now possible to debug a CUDA application on the same NVIDIA GPU that is driving your active display. In fact, you can debug multiple CUDA applications even while others are actively running.Please note that this feature is only available on GPUs with compute capability 3.5 or higher, such as a GTX Titan or GT 640 with GDDR5 memory.To request a topic for a future episode of CUDACasts, or if you have any other feedback, please leave a comment to let us know!
