       " {'question': \"What happens when the 'repo_precache_exts' tool is run with the '-u' or '--update' flag?\",\n",
       "  'answer': \"When the 'repo_precache_exts' tool is run with the '-u' or '--update' flag, it removes the generated part of the kit file, cleans the cache path, and then reruns the extension precaching process to update the version lock.\"},\n",
       " {'question': 'What are the version specification recommendations for apps in Kit?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The general advice is to write the dependencies required-versions for apps the same way as for extensions, in an open-ended form. For example, you can specify dependencies without a specific version or lock them to a major version while allowing minor updates.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'What happens when an extension is specified as exact in the version lock?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Extensions specified as exact in the version lock are not automatically updated by the version lock process. This allows you to manually lock the version for a specific platform or purpose.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'How is an app deployed in Omniverse Launcher?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'An app in Omniverse Launcher is composed of one or more Kit files, precached extensions, and the Kit SDK. It can be run by anyone who has access to the Kit file and can be shared as a file for easy distribution.'},\n",
