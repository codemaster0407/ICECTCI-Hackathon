       " 'memory-consumption-of-ctxgfx-exe-and-wdm-exe': 'We are moving from vmware to citrix hypervisor 8.2 with nvidia T4 Cards (3 per Host). We have 6x Server 2019 RDSH VAD1912CU3 per Host. Each Worker with a T4-8A profile. We are happy with the benefits of the GPU for overall performance, except for system memory. We see a massive increase in Memory consumption in ctxgfx.exe and dwm.exe. Before our avg. ctxgfx.exe per User was ~70MB now with vgpu its ~265MB and avg. dwm.exe was 23MB and now is 253MB.Are these numbers normal with vgpu? I opend a case with citrix but havent gotten any useful feedback yet.Hi,memory consumption depends on the protocol used. But at least for dwm.exe the increase is expected as the desktop window manager needs to do much more work. RDSH doesn’t support “native” NVENC, therefore the increase in ctxgfx.exe is also expected as you cannot offload to the GPU. It would be different for client OS like Win10 where you would see a decrease in ctxgfx.exe.regards\\nSimonWell that is kind of a bummer, i guess i buy more RAM then. In total our Sessions went up 800MB - 1 GB per User. In my old envoirment without vgpu i peak at about 25GB of commited memory for 10 Users and with vGPU its somewhere between 34 - 38 GB. That adds up …How many monitors are the users running? Which resolution? In general, the numbers look really high. I just checked on my Citrix 2106 and Win2022 and the usersession consumes 57MB ctxgfx.exe and 17MB dwm.exe on 1 Full HD screen in idle with vGPU 13.\\nWhich Citrix policies have you assigned for these users? Do you use bitmap codec (Thinwire) or Video Codec (H264/H265) ?Those are the numbers, i was used to. Most users have 2x FullHD and we use most current vGPU 13.1.I have to check Codec tommorow.Thinwire with the option to use video codec for parts of the screen where Video or 3D Stuff is displayed.OK, looks good so far. This would be exactly what I would recommend. ACR (actively changing regions) is most likely the best option in your case. Anyways, the numbers for sysmem consumption of the given processes seems to be way to high. By any chance can you test with the current 2109 on a VM to see if it might be related to the LTSR version ???\\nAnother idea could be that there is an issue with ACR (consuming massive amount of resources). You should also disable ACR for a quick test to run Thinwire only and check again if this reduces the sysmem consumption.Do you think i could just upgrade the VDA Agent on the Worker or would i have to build a complete Testenvoirment?I havent been doing much on the protocoll and policy side of citrix (i mainly work on the Masterimages). How would i disable ACR via GPO. I couldnt find a value when i searched for it, maybe its because we use german templates?Thank you so much for your valuable assistance!Just the VDA is enough. I did further testing. Single screen with video playback (ACR) 100MB ctxgfx and 20MB dwm\\nRunning 2xFullHD increases the processes to 130MB ctxgfx and 27MB dwm.\\nSo it scales with 30% increase for the second screen. Removing the second screen goes directly back to the old numbers.\\nFor better ACR policy understanding check my blog: [5 of 6] Mixed Codec (Adaptive Display) – GRID4ALLI just talked to citrix about the issue, they asked me to check if consumption is as high when the vgpu is disabled. When vGPU is removed from the worker the memory consumption of DWM and ctxgfx is exactly as you described. (100MB and 20 - 30MB). Tommorow i will propably do three tests. First ACR policy, second new VDA Agent. Do you think downgrading nvidia vgpu software from 13.1 to 13.0 could be worth the effort? I dont really wanna mess with the citrix hypervisor to much as it seems to work super stable.No need to downgrade vgpu software. I don’t expect NV to be the cause of the issue here.Current state of the issue. Citrix collected info Hypervisor Team moved the ticket to VAD Team, VAD Team moved ticket after collecting more info back to Hypervisor Team.Disabling ACR and trying different codecs did not change consumption noticeably.Monday we try the VDA 2109 Agent.Ok, thanks for the update. Why should this be related to hypervisor? I’m also running XS8.2 in my environment and I don’t see this behavior. I would assume this is related to the OS or the VDA. Another test might be to run the T4 in Passthrough to see if it makes any difference (rule out vGPU).Just tested with 2109 results look pretty similar.Hi, any chance to test with a vanilla OS (Win2019) to see if this is related to your image?We will try with a vanilla system tommorow.I made some screenshots showing the much higher consumption, maybe this helps?\\ndiff947×774 315 KB\\nThanks but doesn’t really help. I even checked a Win2019 system to rule out the OS in my lab. 20-30MB dwm.exe usage.\\nCould you please also try a plain RDP session to see if at least the dwm stays in the expected range? I assume there is a dependency between ctxgfx.exe and dwm.exe whenever the issue occurs. Maybe a sort of memory leak or something like that. What I forgot to ask: Does this happen for specific sessions only? How much FB is in use when the issue occurs? Screenshot from GPUProfiler possible?Thanks for all your effort.dwm on rdp session (left Taskmanager, right Process Explorer) private bytes and working is still higher.\\ndwm_rdp1047×29 4.2 KB\\nI will split this into 3 replies as there is a single Image limitation on new users.Memory leak should occur over time, right? The high consumption starts right at the beginning of the session.I would say that all sessions show this behavior (we also checked if there is a relation to workspace or endpoint type but the behavior seems identical).In the screenshot we have 9 Users on the system (mix of single and double FHD) only Office/IT Staff some Office 2019, RDP, Webbrowsers, nothing fancy. Eventhough systen memory usage shows 55% the commit charge is at 100% and then the issue occurs.\\nprofiler.PNG1528×691 119 KB\\nWe tried the same test but reduced the FB by 50% and hammered the system as hard as we could to rule out FB exhaustion causing the issue. Latency goes up obiviously but system is stable. Edit: less users to not run into the commit charge issue.\\nprofiler2.PNG1633×1011 178 KB\\ni build a vanilla server 2019 with vGPU Software, its doing windows updates right now. I will install VDA tomorow then test.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Therefore, different driver branches will have updated releases at different times. The drivers come in two versions: \"Long-Term Support Branch\" (LTSB, sometimes referred to as LTSR (R=Release) same thing, different acronym), and the other is what’s known as \"Current Release\" (CR). NVIDIA will typically support three different branches concurrently, one LTSB and two CR versions (this would explain why 7.x was updated after 9.x).The LTSB version (like all other 3rd Party LTSB / LTSR software) is for Customers that want to run a single version for a prolonged period. This is (supposed) to offer a more stable version that requires only security and / or critical updates and typically this branch will not receive any \"feature\" updates over its supported lifetime. This gives consistency, which is (supposed) to make the environment easier to manage, however, this doesn’t account for bugs introduced by 3rd Party products in the LTSR stack (Hypervisor and VDI components). Currently, the only LTSB variant is 8.x and it’s EOL is April 2022.The CR version (like all other 3rd Party CR software) is for Customers who want to run the latest features and functionality in their environments and the support lifetime for each branch is shorter than that of LTSB. The existing CR versions are 9.x which will become EOL on June 2020 and 10.x which will become EOL on December 2020. After which to maintain Support, you will be required to move to a supported version.vGPU features and functionality apply to more than just what’s happening inside the VM. They apply to the rest of the environment as well. Multi vGPU and vGPU Live Migration to mention just two of them. If newer features and functionality are released throughout the lifecycle of an LTSB release, they will typically be available in the next supported branch, not the existing one.If a Customer keeps their entire environment up to date, then CR is the logical choice. This includes running the latest Hypervisor, VDI platform and Applications. CR is the version I always recommend (it has more than long enough support terms (typically one year)). Despite the claim of LTSB being easier to work with due to longer support, I’m yet to find that the case and personally I don’t recommend it and will never implement a stack built around it. LTSB sounds great on the surface, but in reality, vGPU and other component features are being developed and released so quickly, that being stuck on an older release soon brings problems into the environment. For example, a day one release of LTSB is great because at some point in its release cycle it will be the latest release out of all three branches, but two years in to the platform, it’s now three versions behind the CR, and the platform has very limited feature parity to current versions. Again, that may sound ok on the surface, but look at the feature differences between the current CR and LTSB …I mention all of this because you’ve listed four vGPU versions in your post, including CR and LTSB versions. It’s important to understand why you’re running a specific vGPU version, and the implications of doing so.As mentioned, the 8.x branch is LTSB and the 9.x and 10.x are CR. Whatever happens to 8.x, both CR versions will always be more up to date with more features and functionality. The only changes to the 8.x branch will (or certainly should) be security and bug fixes (no features). Whereas 9.x and 10.x will receive security, bug fix and feature updates.Regarding the way they’re displayed on the website, they’re listed by Release Date (most recent at the top). The Versions are self explanatory. If you’re currently running 9.x then you’re running CR. You want to go to 10.x, so remove the 9.x .vib and install the 10.x .vib. Then upgrade your VMs with the appropriate driver (442.06 assuming you go for 10.1) included in the package.RegardsMGWow, thanks for the long answer.

       " 'tesla-m60-tensorflow-cuda-compatibility': 'It is my understanding that the Tesla M10 is mainly developed for multi-device application support etc. We are thinking about purchasing this GPU for deep learning purposes. We have very high memory data so it would be very useful.I have reviewed a lot of documentation online but it’s not clear to me if this GPU can be used with the newest versions of cuda (v10+) and therefore keras and tensorflow. Tesla M10 is also 4 GPUs linked together, so it is possible to utilize the full 32GB of RAM when linked like this? Does nvidia forbid this in any way? Does the card work like 4 separate GPUs or one united one? And I have seen licensing for using it as a vGPU but if we are just connecting this GPU to one server and plan to use it only there, do we need a separate license for this (does that require GRID licensing for instance?)?Thanks for any help here!HiThe M10 is for entry level workloads, it’s not designed for DL. The CUDA Core count is pretty low, so you’d be better looking at other GPUs. Also, the 4 GPUs are separate, meaning 4 x 8GB, not 1 x 32GB. Even if you add all GPUs to a single VM, your application may use 4 GPUs but it will only make use of 8GB Memory total.For DL, at a minimum, you’d be better looking at either a P100 (16GB) or P40 (24GB) which are both high-performance single GPUs. As you’ve mentioned you use a lot of Memory the P100 might be a good choice due to using HBM2, whereas although the P40 has 24GB, it uses GDDR5 which has a lot less bandwidth, however it does have a few hundred more CUDA Cores (3584 vs 3840), so it depends which your workload makes more use of.If you use vGPU, then you need a license (probably vCompute (vCS)). However, if you install it in Passthrough then you can use the standard Tesla driver without the need for a license.Either option will be far superior to an M10.RegardsMGWow thanks you confirmed my suspicions for this GPU - seems like it is just not in the market for what we are thinking about. P100 and P40 are really out of our price range right now…we have been training on AWS and looking to get something in house for training and using AI in our current architecture. I am now leaning towards something like the Titan RTX…Can you explain why if P100 has less memory HBM2 makes it more desirable than GDDR5? Most past training was on a 4GB GeForce 745 or 16GB Tesla V100 on Amazon. We have a mix of 2&3D images so the local GeForce can do small batches of 2D but any 3D images needed to go on Amazon and still only process 1 image/batch.HiBecause HBM2 is much faster than GDDR5, so it depends how your application / workload uses the hardware. Typically you want to get data into the GPU and process it as fast as possible, so HBM2 would be better in this instance. If you needed more capacity than 16GB, then the P40 would obviously be better due to having a higher capacity. The V100 has HBM2 as well.The Titan RTX is a good GPU, just be careful of its cooling requirements when pushed hard for long periods. There’s a reason why the Quadro GPUs all have Blower fans …RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'gpu-accelerate-one-rdsh-windows-server-2019-on-vmware-essentials-plus': 'Dear NVIDIA experts.Since Windows Server 2016/2019 RDSH we are experiencing high CPU load with at many customers, with the same amount of users, where Server 2012R2 had no problems at all.\\nTrying out and talking a lot with others, we’ve run into the result, that 2016/2019 simply needs GPU performanceNow we want to accelerate NORMAL RDSH users (no CAD application, etc.) on ONE RDSH host with NVIDIA GPU performance at the minimum level of at least license costs (so NO GRID, NO VMWare Enterprise plus if possible).\\nAs Hypervisor we run VMWare 7.0 (Essentials Plus license).\\nWe know without GRID and VMWare Enterprise plus, we can only share the full GPU direct to the VM, and lose also functions like VMotion, Snapshot, etc.We’ve checked the VMWare Compatibilty guide, and the\\nTESLA T4\\nwould be supported in our Hardware/VMWare constellation with vDGA, so far. So we’ve already put a T4 to one of our VMWare hosts, and it’s recognized. But now we have some questions:HiYou’re using the wrong GPU.If you want to use any Tesla GPU with Graphics, you’ll need to pay for that feature. If you don’t want to pay for any licenses, you need to use a Quadro GPU in Passthrough, then you can use the standard Quadro driver from the public website.You need to configure the default Graphics adapter and you can do that with a GPO.RegardsMGHi,Sorry for that delay, didn’t got the notification.\\nSo TESLA GPU is only possible with GRID implementation and licenses, right?For our purpose (one 2019-RDSH, fixed to one VM 7.0 ESXi host), would you say the Quadro adapter is the better choice, if we just experience high CPU load, because 2016/2019 seems to expect GPU for a lot of things?\\nWould be a NVIDIA Quadro RTX4000 be usable WITHOUT GRID, so for our purposes?Another thing, I’m confused: How can you change the default graphics adapter?\\nI just found the GPO, which tells RDP using the default graphics adapter, but not how to define a NVIDIA card as the default graphics adapter (instead of the VMWare one)And a second question using GRID licenses:Of course we would like to pay for the GRID licenses as they are not that expensive.\\nBut is there actually any method, using the T4 with GRID WITHOUT a VMWare Enterprise license?In the moment we just have VMWare vSphere 7 Essentials Plus licensed at the customer. And the really expensive seems to be the VMWare Enterprise license, not the GRID itself.Publishing the T4 just to one VM, limited to one ESXI host wouldn’t be the problem for us. As well, not having VMotion available or that memory has to be taken the full amount as reserved.Because upgrading the license to VMWare Enterprise is the really expensive topic here, i think.Or what would you recommend?HiYes, the RTX4000 will be fine for initial testing, but it only has 8GB of framebuffer, this may be ok depending on your workload and user density, but it will be the first thing you max out.You don’t need to explicitly define the Default Graphics Adapter, just configuring the GPO will be sufficient.If you run the T4 in Passthrough, you should be able to use the vGPU driver with it and then license it accordingly (QvDWS / vApps / vCS) per CCU depending on your workload. As you’re not virtualizing the GPU, you won’t need (VMware) Enterprise Plus licensing. Obviously, you’ll then run in to all the usual limitations of not virtualising, but at least it should work.RegardsMGHi Mr. Grid,So in our case I think you would recommend using the T4, as there is a \"cheaper\" way to use it without VMWare Enterprise Plus, as you described, and in case it’s too less, we still have the option to use more complex GPU virtualization scenarios like cascading the T4 and use GPU virtualization with Enterprise plus license, right?I’m a little bit afraid of the RTX4000, because you can find some informations of crashing DWM.exe, if there are more than 15-30 users on a RDSH, so it could be a one-way-street, with problems:Microsoft Q&A is the best place to get answers to all your technical questions on Microsoft products and services. Community. Forum.Or is there a third way, you could recommend to us in our case?Hi,We’ve successfully passthrough the T4 to the GRID driver in Windows Server over ESXi 7.0 without VMWare Enterprise license\\nGPU is responsable and GRID licensing is working.\\nJust a last question:In the PCI Device passthrough-section of ESXI-host I have 32 device IDs from 1 T4 card.\\nFirst of all, I cannot select all of them for passthrough, but is it enough to select ONE device ID, and the whole GPU is addressed to my VM?\\nAnd how can I check, that the whole GPU performance is available on my VM?\\n830×376 45.5 KB\\n\\n\\n832×600 53.2 KB\\nHiIf that link is the only source you have of a reported issue with the RTX4000, then I really wouldn’t worry about it. Besides, with only 8GB of FB and 30 users crammed on to it, the user you’ve linked to is probably running out of Framebuffer which is causing his issue. He states he tested with lower resolutions compared to his production ones. No idea why you’d test with one use case, then use a different one in production? …For the T4, adding just one of them will be sufficient. You can test whether it’s working by using tools like GPUProfiler: https://github.com/JeremyMain/GPUProfiler/releasesRegardsMGHi,Thank you, so checking one T4 hardware ID in the passthrough section is sufficient.Regarding dwm.exe there are several issues reporting crashing dwm.exe with RTX4000 like also:1 vote and 2 comments so far on Reddithttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/6779b586-c158-491c-b76b-353d5a490642/server-2016-rds-connections-maxing-out-and-crashing-dwmexe?forumIn the meantime, ourself we experienced crashing DWM.exe, with T4 passthrough and GRID driver, when around 50-55 users are logged in to the server, and GPU memory of 15 GB is nearly used completely, that’s the time, when dwm.exe crashes.\\nIs there any possibility to avoid that? If we put a second T4 into the system, and passthorugh again, we can use both T4 and the double of memory, over the GRID driver, and should be able to avoid that crashing dwm.exe, or not?HiYou can’t put 2x GPUs in the same VM and split the load across the GPUs, that’s not how RDSH works. You’ll need another VM and run the additional T4 in Passthrough with that. Then you’ll need to load-balance the VMs so you get an even user / workload distribution.RegardsMGOkay, so that won’t solve my problem.\\nWhat’s about that crashing dwm.exe? Is it actually connected to the size of the buffer, and if the buffer is full or not, or is it about something else, which won’t be solved with a SINGLE GPU with 32GB memory for example?\\nOffloading the user to two RDSH will be a solution of course too, but we normally would have just one…Btw: Are you sure, RDSH is not supporting multiple GPUs?\\nBecause at Microsoft they tell, loadbalancing from multiple GPUs presented to the OS is supported since Server 2019\\nWhatsApp Image 2020-12-14 at 12.25.09695×492 65.9 KB\\nYes, I’m sure. Try it and see for yourself if you like :-)Is 50 concurrent users on a single VM not enough? The whole idea of this is that you then have multiple VMs of the same spec running on the host and scale out across the physical host. With most modern servers supporting at least 6x T4s, if not more, that would be 300 concurrent users per host, assuming you didn’t run into CPU or Storage contention before hitting that number.RegardsMGI’ve built a lot of VM infrastructure for high density deployments in data center hosting environments. The amount of RAM and/or IOPS are always the first two things to run out of if unless you solve for both with providing ample amounts of RAM and IOPS with with SSD or NVME disks. You should be quite happy with 50 concurrent users on a single VM honestly. For high density, you can push it, but you need more physical resources to realistically accommodate that requirement. You’re trying to push Niagara Falls through a garden hose there.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

This computer is used for scientific data processing and all kinds of files, ranging from gb to tb.The problem is the M10 graphic that the system does not recognize it, it uses an Ubuntu system, which in the nvidia panel if it reflects the 4 memory modules and if it recognizes the model of the card as TESLA M10.In the information tells me that in each module are entering 18w and that its use is 0%, the temperature starts normal 35 º, 40 º. As time goes by without any data processing the graphic starts to heat up by itself reaching a temperature of 90 ° then I decided to turn off the system as it did not seem normal and more with a passive cooling graphic like this.After a few minutes I start the computer and try to launch a process for both graphics, but this process only runs on the TITAN V in the tesla m10 still does not “recognize it”.For ease and compatibility I opted to change the disk and install a w10 from 0 clean to see if from Windows to get it to work.At the time of booting the desktop update the system to the maximum, I recognize the TITAN V and I download the Gforce to see if the tesla m10 I get from the panel nvida, I do not get. In the device manager it shows me the 4 memory modules of that card, but I can’t install any driver. The card starts to warm up on the desktop with virtually no stress for it.I tried this card in the 3 PCI available on the board and got the same result.Since from Nvidia and PNY tell me that these cards are only for vgpu and desktop virtualization and also have to be used in a certified servers and with a license of this type of “software”.My question in this post is, if there is any possibility to work with this TESLA M10 graphics card for scientific data processing?I have tried with other drivers to see if I could “fit” m60, m6, etc for Windows server and ubuntu on both platforms without any possibility or any result.Please if anyone has any information or if this card has a hardware lock which does not allow such use.Best regards and thanks!Translated with DeepL Translate: The world's most accurate translator (free version)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled\",\n",

Say one host has an M10, and another host in the same VMware Cluster has both an M10 and an M60, this warning will show because they are different within the same cluster demarcation.A way to work around this is to create multiple clusters with homogeneous hosts in them. Or like in my lab, in my vCenter inventory, there’s 3 clusters, each only with one host, just for this reason.The error has no consequences whatsoever, so you can also just ignore it.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

What I want to do is to assign each CPU core with its own GPU to reach the best performance. After some googling, here is the procedure to do it in one node:This is working good. However, I need to run this with more nodes (ie two nodes). I changed my command to srun -n 16 --mpi=pmix --cpunobind=none ./script_gpu pyfr .... but this is not working. I tried srun without script which is working but not working with best performance. Advised by some discussions online I tried numactl rather than taskset but also not working.

So a simple driver install is what we would need.Unfortunately you are right. I overlooked the vSphere comment. Thought you are using KVM. You will need the NVAIE trial.

You can only use the C-profile which means starting with T4-4C as you stated above. Simply remove the Q profile and add the C profile to the VM.Sorry, I forgot to say “Thank you, Simon!”.

       " 'problems-with-perfomance-vgpu-dell-r730-vmware-esxi-6-7-tesla-p40': 'Hello.\\nAcquired NVIDIA Tesla P40 graphics card for use in virtualization.\\nDell R730 Server, E5-2667v4, all-Flash, VMware ESXi hypervisor, 6.7.0, 17098360\\nWe registered and received a 90-day trial license, installed the NVIDIA-GRID-vSphere-6.7-450.89-452.57 drivers. The licensing server runs on Windows Server 2012R2 x64 (License Client Manager version 2020.05.0.28406365 x64).\\nThe problem is this:\\nRegardless of the selected profile (1…8q), the performance does not change in tests and in operation. The main work is related to CAD applications, performance measurement is carried out using the Red Turbine Demo and Solidworks 2020 Performance test. Are there performance limitations in the trial license? If there are not, how can we properly measure the performance for each profile?I’m assuming you’re using this in VGPU mode, can you cofirm what EUC you’re using? Horizon/Citrix?Also can you confirm thatAlso will note in testing once i got to a suitable profile (2b), using a better profile didn’t get me better performance, though to be fair i didn’t do synthetic testing, just real world loads that my users would hit.  To make sure though i did remove the gpu to see what a non accelerated load would perform.Last thing I’d note, double check the vGPU guide, they qualify certain vgpu/OS/Hypervisor combos, that if not matched will give you bad performance.Ah, not sure on benchmarks, I used real testing to get an idea of load per user and monitored that by directly monitoring gpu and framebuffer usage and scaling for our load.As for horizon, can’t help much there, FWIW we tried horizon before we went with citrix, as deployment seemed much simpler, and licensing would’ve saved us 30%, but we found vgpu performance in a greenfield deployment following all docs to a T to be the same as pure cpu.We’re sure there was something wrong with our setup but after spending for a vmware suggested consultant and them confirming our setup looked perfect, they referring us to support.  Vmware support then took ~6 weeks of throwing darts and requested we rebuild and collect diags before we finally asked for a refund and tried Citrix VAADS.  With VAADS we were up and with great performance inside of a day.Hi1Q >> 24Q vGPU Profiles all have identical performance, assuming the default (Best Effort) Scheduler is used and you are not Framebuffer limited. Unless you are Framebuffer limited, increasing the amount of Framebuffer with a bigger vGPU Profile will not change the performance of the GPU or your application. If you start playing with the Scheduler, that’s a different conversation, but you already have the maximum performance available to you.A far better test would be to use a relevant benchmarking utility (Redway Turbine is not) and use something from SPEC like their new SPECviewperf 2020 release. This is where you’ll clearly see the difference between all of the vGPU Profiles.You’ve mentioned CAD as a main workload … CAD is typically CPU limited, if you require better CAD performance, you need newer hardware so that you can run better (newer generation) CPUs, as the Intel v4 are an old architecture. Your Clock Speed is ok (faster is better), but the age of the CPU is really holding it back.If you can’t upgrade the Server to an R740XD / R7525, then there are a few things you can do to help improve things with what you have:1: Upgrade your virtualisation software. ESXi 6.7 is pretty old.\\n2: Make sure your Server Firmware, BIOS etc are all fully up to date.\\n3: Make sure your Server BIOS is tuned for Performance, and make sure ESXi can control it. Lots of tuning guides out there for this.\\n4: Make sure the ESXi Host its self is configured for Performance - not Balanced or other.\\n5: Make sure your CAD VMs are running on SSD / NVMe storage.\\n6: Make sure your VMs are running the latest supported version of Windows 10 (2004 at time of writing, even though H2 is now available) (or Server 2019 (currently 1809) if running Server VDI) and that you’ve tuned / optimised that Operating System using one of the many tools out there.\\n7: Make sure you’re running the latest VMTools and vGPU Software.As a starting point, you should be looking to configure your CAD VMs with the following Spec and optimize from there:vCPUs: 4-6 Cores @ 3.0Ghz+ (3.0Ghz minimum - Faster is better, adding more Cores won’t typically help)\\nSystem RAM: 12GB (or higher depending on usage)\\nvGPU: 4GB & QvDWS License (4GB at least or higher depending on model size, screen resolution etc)\\nStorage: SSD / NVMeIf you do that with your current platform, you’ve pretty much maxed it out. Any additional performance will need to come from optimizing your CAD models to suit your hardware, or newer hardware.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

I want a minimal infrastructure for this purpose. Can I use only VMware vSphere for my purpose, without Horizon? Which software and licenses needed?Where described the installation process?Thank you!HiYou need vCenter Standard and vSphere Enterprise Plus. You’ll also need a connection protocol that’s good enough to support your specific workload and handle your users peripherals (3D Space Mice etc).If you were to use Horizon, vCenter and vSphere licenses are included, and it’s available in packs of 10, so it fits your use case perfectly. You could then use the Direct Connect option to save you having to deploy all the back end components.Alternatively, you could simply use something like Teradici Cloud Access Plus or Mechdyne TGX. These require no supporting backend infrastructure, however you’ll need to purchase vCenter Standard and vSphere Enterprise Plus licenses.Regardless of your choice, you’ll need NVIDIA QvDWS licensing for either deployment which is licensed per CCU, so you’ll need 10 of them.RegardsMGThank you for your answer, MG.Can you describe following information. What is the price of licenses.

You’ll be limited to 1 user Per GPU in Passthrough. Or, you’ll need to run RDSH, again using the GPU in Passthrough and using the standard Quadro driver (not vGPU). You’ll still need a good connection protocol mentioned above.Speak to your local vGPU reseller for the best vGPU pricing.

       " 'tesla-k80-initital-setup-problem': 'Hi all, I ma new to the Tesla community.  I recently set up a machine for CAD combined with CFD and FEA.  Machine specs are:Dual Xeon Silver 4216\\n128 GB Memory\\nAsus WS C621E SAGE main board\\nHDDs are all solid state NVMe\\nAsus GeForce RTX2070 video card\\nPSU: Corsair AX1600i (main) Corsair RX850 (for a little extra power)\\nLatest BIOS installedI bought three Tesla K80s of Amazon.  They were used and re-certified so I bought the insurance with them.I am having issues getting the machine to boot after installing the first card.  I have Above 4G Decoding enabled and my machine does POST and begins loading windows but hangs up and says it could not start windows.  so I am trying to narrow down what the issue could be.No NVIDIA Tesla drivers are loaded yet…cant load them until a TESLA is installed and windows startsLocation on main board…The GeForce RTX 2070 is in slot 7 (bottom) and I installed the first Tesla in slot 5.  the closest they can physically be located.  Other cards will go into slots 1 and 3 once the first card is workingNot compatible with mother board or combo of GeForce and Tesla on the same board (god I hope not)Thermal issue…the card was seriously hot. I have rad that these will heat up and need active cooling but it sounded like that’s only the case when you are really taxing them.   I know I have to add active cooling and I am 3D printing a duct to move allot of air but the duct is not done yetBad card?I have plenty of power and its wired up right, maybe I just have to wait until the air duct is done to cool it and try again if the heat is causing it to shut down.  I have not tried putting it into a different slot.Thanks\\nScottHiUnfortunately I don’t think that’s going to work.You’re using a current generation GeForce GPU with a really old Tesla GPU and they have massively different driver requirements and they’re about as far apart in physical architecture as you can get.If you’re trying to benefit from Graphics and Compute, using 2 different GPU models is quite an old way of doing it. This used to be called NVIDIA Maximus, but it’s not used any more due to advancements in architecture. The last time I used this approach was back in 2015, but I was using a Quadro and Tesla, not GeForce. I was running an M6000 and K80 and that worked. Today, I’d just use a single, current generation GPU which would massively out perform that configuration.You 100% need a fan to cool the K80, it’s not optional. Whether you’re running workloads on it or it’s sat there idle, otherwise you’ll damage it. It needs very good air flow - just as any other Passive GPU does. Or, you need an appropriate chassis that’s designed for Passive GPUs. Your insurance is unlikely to cover thermal damage.Regardless of whether the system will boot or not, I don’t think this will work. I’m pretty sure that you need a Quadro driver to support the Tesla, and you can’t use that because you have GeForce in there.Being completely honest, to save you a lot of time, hassle, frustration and being underwhelmed at the K80s performance, here’s a bit of guidance … Return the RTX2070 and 3 K80s and get a refund. Purchase 1 Quadro GP100. These are based on the Pascal architecture. They have very good Graphics and Compute capability in a single GPU and will be much better for what you’re trying to do. It has 16GB of HBM2 memory and is a seriously powerful bit of kit!! It’s also an \"Active\" GPU (meaning it has a fan built in) so no need to mess around building your own, and it will use less power / generate less heat. You can purchase GP100s on eBay for a little over £1K if you shop around, which is probably not much more than the cost of all your existing GPUs (plus insurance) together. If you go down this path, make sure you go for the GP100, not the P100. The GP100 is Active and has display heads on the back of it so you can connect your monitors. It’s designed to go in a Workstation (just like you’re doing). The P100 on the other hand is headless and Passive, it’s designed to go in a Server. Performance between them is the same, but if you buy the P100, you won’t be able to use it unless you use virtualisation. Just something to be aware of.More modern GPUs are available like the GV100 which is built on Volta, but these are more expensive. You could use a Titan V (again Volta), but you’re then back to using using the GeForce gaming driver again, not Quadro, so I’d avoid this. The Titan V has less RAM than the GP100 (12GB), but it’s still HBM2, so is very fast! But if you’re doing CAD / CFD / FEA, then driver support is very important! For reference, NVIDIA’s Titan product line is classed as \"Prosumer\", so it’s a step up in terms of hardware from (Consumer) GeForce, but still uses the GeForce driver.The easiest, most cost effective way to do what you’re after is use the GP100.That’s the best bit of advice I can offer.RegardsMGThanks for responding.  I was a bit afraid this could be the case but also figured I could run the GPUs independently.  The GP100 is just about beyond what I’d like to invest in this machine right now.  in the states I’m looking at $2700 or so.  I have seen several posts on other forums where they were successful and satisfied with running a GTX1080 and K80 together so I figured there is a way to get an RTX2070 and K80 to run together.that was a recent post but if it doesn’t work for me I’ll rethink and see about going dow n the road you are suggesting.  I do appreciate your notes.Cooling: no doubt!  At 300W I expected that.  I have designed a duct that fits in my case and combines the flow from two 120mm fans to three ports to supply flow to all thee cards and dump about 20 percent to the board controller.  Just waiting to get it printed.HiIf you were planning to add all 3 K80s in there as well, then that’s going to be pretty expensive to cool and run! (unless you have a good electricity rate where you are :-) )I didn’t try with a GeForce GPU / GeForce driver, but if others are saying that they have it working, then it must work. The GP100 route would still be my recommendation, I just think longer term overall it will be better for you and if you wanted more performance at some point in the future, then you could purchase a second one and run them in NVLink. The route you’re going down with this setup is very limited and will be expensive to run due to the K80(s).Assuming you have it installed, you could try uninstalling the existing GeForce driver, make sure to install the RTX into the primary PCIe slot as this is what the system will be using for most of the time (as it will be providing the visuals). Install the K80 in the second PCIe slot, boot the system and if possible install the latest NVIDIA driver with the Clean Install box checked just to make sure it’s a clean install. I can’t think of anything else at this point, as your system gets past POST and starts booting.Try that and see how you get onRegardsMGHi, just found this while searching for answers to similar situation… .was told that Tesla is a GPU but apparently that is not fully accurate. I do not have any other cards but it sounds like the setup can work with Quadro plus Teslas? Should i return the Tesla… I thought wish 24 GB it would be pretty powerful.MG could you send me an email or call?

       " 'horizon-video-playback-performance': 'Hello,I have performance problems with playback of videos in my VDI machines.  I’m using Blast Extreme accelerated by a Nvidia P40 GPU. Playback is always a little bit stuttering. I usually get a better result from my Linux VDI pool that isn’t GPU accelerated. If I check with youtube the problem seems to be related with encoding  since I don’t se dropped frames reported by the video player.What is your experience in fullscreen video playback with the P series?CristianoHi,I’m having no issues and super smooth playback even with 4k and Youtube with P40. Which browser are you using?\\nIf you would using a Maxwell board I would assume the issue is related to decoding but Pascal already supports VP9 hardware decoding (used from Youtube) so that this cannot be the issue.\\nWhat OS and resolution are you using?RegardsSimonHello Simon,I’m using W10 64 1709 with 3 cpu and 5GB of Ram, storage is all flash. The profile is just a P40-1Q since I’m going for density. I’ve tried with edge firefox and chrome, aeme issue. Decoding the video from youtube shouldn’t be the issue, I don’t see dropped frames. The issue is not just youtube, every video app is a little bit jerky. I also tried the Nvidia lab, that is available with registration and playback is smooth there. I have also an SR open with VMware, so I’m working on multiple fronts.regardsCristianoHi Cristiano,could you please change the scheduler from default (equal share) to best effort for your deployment and test once again? I’m curious to hear if it makes any difference.Documentation for administrators that explains how to install and configure NVIDIA Virtual GPU manager, configure virtual GPU software in pass-through mode, and install drivers on guest operating systems.regardsSimonHello Simon,Wen I will upgrade to 5.2 I will try that, since it requires a restart. Right now is difficult for me to find a windows for downtimeRegardsCristianoHello Simon,didn’t switch mode, but GPU wise it seems ok, those are the statistics:GPU Session Process   Codec       H       V Average     Averageso it seems that encoding is fine. Are 80/90 FPS not a little too much?\\nAlso decoding should be fine as youtube doesn’t report dropped frames.RegardsCristianoHi Cristiano,it depends on the scheduler. As default scheduler has no FRL it renders more than 60fps.\\nYou can switch to best effort to have FRL=60fps which is more than sufficient. And I agree that the GPU cannot be the issue in your case as we render more than enough frames :)RegardsSimonTry using the GRID 5.1 drivers instead.I`m experiencing the same problem that Christiano mentioned before.We got Tesla P40 GPU`s in an Horizon environment in version 7.4.0 on ESXi Hosts (HPE DL380G10) in version 6.5U1.\\nI´ve already switched the scheduler to best effort, but did not see a difference.\\nI am using 2 full hd monitors and the blast extreme protocol.\\nThe vGPU profile i am using is \"grid_p40-2q\".This is the output i get from the hypervisor shell when i run \"nvidia-smi vgpu -es\":\\nThis output was generated while playing a YouTube video through firefox.\\nAt the first \"7 fps\" lines the video was not startet, it startet later when those fps counters rose.\\nIt seems like the GPU is rendering way too much frames, but i thought it is limited due to the best effort scheduler…Any advice on how to fix this?Hi prinz,could you run \"nvidia-smi encodersessions\" within the VM?For me it works as expected with P40-2Q and best effort playing a FullHD FULL screen youtube video:RegardsSimonI wonder about the effectiveness of the 1Q profile for full 4K video.  I’ve been looking at the difference between P6-1Q, P6-2Q and P6-4Q profiles and video performance.  4Q is super smooth, but with 2Q there is roughly a 25% drop in performance and with a 1Q profile a further 25% drop from there.I have default scheduler settings and have put this down to simple frame buffer capacity but something doesn’t sit right with me in that the software encoding engine (Blast in this case) is still doing the same number of pixels (the same video is being used) so why should the frame buffer make such a difference?Hello Simon,i ran the command \"nvidia-smi encodersessions\" within the VM while playing a YouTube 1080p video and got that output:If i connect to the desktop-pool with only one active monitor and watch the exact same video in fullscreen, i get that output:On the hypervisor it looks like this when i play the video with one active monitor:If i run \"nvidia-smi vgpu -q\" on the hypervisor, I can see the line \"Frame Rate Limit: 60FPS\", but it does not limit anything if i get this right…Regards,\\nDominikHi Dominik,I agree this looks like you don’t have FRL in place. Could you please double check that you’re running Best Effort scheduler? Try the latest GRID6.1 package and you should have Best Effort by default…RegardsSimonHi Simon,so I ran this command on the hypervisor to set the best effort scheduler and rebooted the hosts:\\nesxcli system module parameters set -m nvidia -p \"NVreg_RegistryDwords=RmPVMRL=0x00\"But I dont see any difference. The frame rates are still way to high.\\nThe question is, on which layer the problem occurs first.\\nIt can be the hypervisor, the VM config, the Guest OS or the NVIDIA driver on the OS.\\nSo i set the preference on the lowest layer, which should be fine.\\nI read the installation manual multiple times and I cant figure out any config errors done by me.\\nI have to correct that we are now on ESXi 6.5U2, maybe there is a known bug or problem?\\nWe are on the latest GRID 6.1 software (host driver version: 390.57).UPDATE: I did further investigation and noticed a very interesting benchmark behaviour. This was tested with the Unigine Valley Benchmark. While the benchmark is running, the FPS-Counter in the application tells, that you are almost fixed at 67/68 sometimes 70FPS, while the hypervisor (nvidia-smi vgpu -es) tells you this:The benchmark feels like the frames are dropping very hard, but the FPS-Counter and the hypervisor tells you, that there are no frame-drops at all. Where/what can be the cause of this odd behaviour?ANOTHER UPDATE: I imported the View GPOs and set the MaxFPS-Blast GPO to 60 fps. It feels much much smoother now, but the frame rates are still pretty high and you can feel some sort of \"lag\" if you move windows quick or even in some video sequences, but no comparison to before (Max 30 FPS).So I think the main problem is found and stupid simple.\\nBut for the fine tuning and the problem with the high fps I would be very pleased if I get further help here.Thank you for your helpful advice and effort!Regards,\\nDominikWhat are the min QP and max QP settings in the Blast Extreme session?\\nAnd are you using UDP or TCP?What are the min QP and max QP settings in the Blast Extreme session?\\nAnd are you using UDP or TCP?The QP settings are the default ones. We tried UDP and TCP, but there is no noticeable difference. I dont think, that this problem is a Blast setting. My guess is, that the frame rate limiter on the hypervisor is not working correctly. Blast displays only 60FPS due to the GPO I set, but the hypervisor renders way more frames than this. This is very bad for the user experience and of course also the user density, since one user could claim nearly all the performance of that physical GPU.Hi Prinz,I disagree. Let’s discuss this offline. Please send me a PM.regardsSimonI’m having the same results as others on this forum with Horizon blast (7.7) stuttering playback with H264 encoding enabled. We are using P40 cards, using 4Q and grid driver 412.16. Was this ever resolved?This sounds similar to my issue.Any solution?\\nI have the same issuePowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Seems like the reason we are struggling to get full autonomous cars is because we are trying to skip tech step. Am I wrong?

I already suggest them VMware or any VM solution but they don’t want and strictly they want to use flexibility of having bare metal server.I have 2 suggestion in my mindoption a) 1x RTX 6000 and 10x Vapp ( I suppose even without VM I need this Vapp I don’t know what it is)\\noption b) 2x RTX 2080 TI with NVLINK and enable graphic acceleration on terminal server.Do you guys have any suggestion regarding option a or option b or any other option that I can’t think of ?\\nDo I really need RTX 6000 and vApp when I use baremetal ?Thanks in advance\\nRegardsHiWhichever version of AutoCAD is being used, increasing the CPU Clock Speed will improve the performance. 10 RDSH Users do not need 36 Physical Cores / 76 Threads, and as there are only 10 Users, they can get away with using a lower Core Count but with a much higher Clock Speed. 3.0Ghz is about the minimum you’d want for a good AutoCAD experience and faster is recommended if possible. The following would be my current choice for a 10 User AutoCAD deployment and these CPUs will provide a big increase in overall system performance and especially for AutoCAD:quick reference guide including specifications, features, pricing, compatibility, design documentation, ordering codes, spec codes and more.For the GPU, they should be using one that uses a Quadro driver, not a Consumer Gaming one. They may not need RTX 6000 levels of performance and a cheaper way to do it might be to use something like an RTX 4000 (8GB) or RTX 5000 (16GB). Neither of these will require a license and they will both use the Quadro driver. An RTX 6000 can be used if you think it necessary (there are multiple reasons for choosing this, including future proofing and flexibility), and if you use it with the publicly available Quadro driver (not the vGPU one) it won’t need a license either.Make sure you monitor the Users physical workstations for hardware utilisation before recommending a GPU. This is a great utility to use to capture those metrics: Releases · JeremyMain/GPUProfiler · GitHub You can then decide which GPU to go for once you’ve accounted for the combined utilisation.RegardsMGHi MrGRID,Thank you very much your valuable information and direct me to correct solution, since they already have 2x Xeon 6154 I am just thinking if I could change to 2x Xeon 6250 will there be any tangible outcome.I am thinking of getting a RTX 6000 with Quadro driver not vGPU for future proof. Is there any benefit of using vGPU on Bare metal anyway?  for example I have seen Vapps but I don’t know if I use that on bare metal is it going to be any difference. Do you think 1x RTX 6000 better than 2x Quadro RTX 5000 with NVLINK ?I will investigate utility you are referring and trying to understand it.Thank you\\nRegardsHiRegarding my CPU recommendation … An increase of nearly 1Ghz per Core for an application that is typically limited by CPU Clock Speed will give a notable performance boost! Usually, choosing the best CPU is a trade-off between Cores vs Clock Speed due to having to support multiple users, however, as your Customer only has 10 Users, there is no trade-off as the fastest Xeon CPUs have enough Cores to support the total user density. That’s a great position to be in! Don’t forget that will be a system wide performance boost, not just in AutoCAD.The CPUs they currently have are sub-optimal for this specific environment.If you use a Quadro GPU in Bare-metal or with a Hypervisor in Passthrough with the publicly available Quadro driver, there is no license to pay. Besides, you wouldn’t use vApps licensing with Autodesk products as the performance would be poor.The RTX 6000 is a better choice in my opinion because it can support vGPU if your Customer ever decided to make the switch to a virtualised environment. Anything in the Quadro line-up below an RTX 6000 does not support vGPU. Regarding NVLink, for this kind of workload I really wouldn’t bother.RegardsMGThank you MD,I am going to replace cpus the one you suggest.My last question is does it make any difference to have 1x or 2x GTX 6000? based on my bare metal server without using VM or vAPP but using just plain Quadro driver?thank youHiA single RTX 6000 is more than sufficient for this kind of deployment, if anything it’s too much. A Multi-GPU install would be a complete waste for this deployment, as it would be hugely over-spec’d and underutilised, not to mention Multi-GPU is not recommended for RDSH deployments.The reason I haven’t recommended a lower spec GPU for this deployment, is because you would then lose future proofing due to the next model down in the Quadro line being an RTX 5000 (even though from a performance perspective, it’s perfectly capable). If I were to suggest a T4 (from the Tesla line), then you would need an external vGPU License Server and you would then need QvDWS Licenses for every Concurrent User.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

It didn’t make sense.Unfortunately you are wrong. It doesn’t matter what type of deployment you are using. If you want WDDM support for DC GPUs like Tesla P40 you need a driver that supports it and this is only the vGPU driver.

Now the Update for Version 15 is on my desk  and i think about moving to the Cloud Licensing Server. I saw in the release notes Proxys are now supported.Did you end up opening some URLs… or did you manage to run licensing through the proxy?Thanks a lotKind Regards DavidPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

In the VM i can see the graphics card in the device manger.  However when i try to run something open gl it errors out.  If<a target=‘_blank’ rel=‘noopener noreferrer’ href=‘i run something via direct x the gpu isn’t doing anything according to perfmon.  Is there something i ne’>i run something via direct x the gpu isn’t doing anything according to perfmon.  Is there something i need to do to force the VM to use the new graphics card.HiFirstly, are you using the driver from the vGPU License Portal and does it have a license applied?Secondly, what type of VM is it? Windows 10 or RDSH?RegardsMGi’m just using the driver from nvidia’s website, is there a special licenced driver that i need?i’m trying to run RDSH on a windows server 2019.HiYou should be using the driver from here https://nvid.nvidia.com which requires an account and a license.As you’re not using vGPU (which you can’t with Hyper-V) you would be better off with a Quadro GPU and then use the standard Quadro driver from the NVIDIA website. That also wouldn’t require a license.As you’re running RDSH, you need to enable this GPO:Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Remote Session Environment > Use hardware graphics adapter for all Remote Desktop Services sessionsRegardsMGis there a quadro driver that i could use w/ my tesla card?I’ve done the gpo thing.is there a better way to benchmark if i’m utilizing the tesla card other then the unreal heaven benchmark?  Every time i try running it using open gl I get an error!\"GLAppWindow::create_context(): wglGetProcAddress():failed engin::video_restart    …\"i’m not sure if that just an issue w/ the program or because it can’t access the proper hardware?HiQuadro GPUs use a Quadro driver, with the exception of the RTX 6000 and RTX 8000 which can use either Quadro or vGPU.Tesla GPUs use a Tesla driver for Passthrough / bare-metal Compute or a vGPU driver for virtualised workloads (Compute or Graphics).Yes. Unless your users run Heaven all day, it’s a pointless test and is only really for amusement as it proves nothing. Running benchmarks on VMs can be very misleading anyway as you really need to understand what it is you’re trying to prove, and isn’t really something that should factor into any technical decision too much, unless you’re trying to compare like for like with physical vs virtual, but even then, there are so many reason why it’s not a valid test. There are frame rate limiters built into the software layer so they all need to be turned off for bench marking otherwise the results will be limited, and it’s kind of pointless as when your users access the platform, it’s best to have those limiters enabled to balance the utilisation.If you want a more comprehensive test, you should be running one of the applicable \"SPEC\" benchmarks. They are industry standard for 3D workloads from the major ISVs (Dassault, PTC, Autodesk, Siemens etc etc) and will give your platform a proper workout! But again, you still need to disable the various limiters and then tweak settings throughout your entire stack right down to the Server BIOS to achieve the highest score, and it all just gets a bit unrealistic as you’ll never push the platform that hard in that way.You’re far better off using the applications you plan to actually use and testing with them, you’ll get much more realistic usable results.Out of interest, what do you plan to use the platform for and which remoting protocol are you using to access the VM?RegardsMGit’s an industry specific CAD software call Mitek Sapphire Structure  https://www.mitek-us.com/software/SAPPHIRE-Structure/we just plan on using RDP out the gate, we may look at citrix if we are having luck w/ RDP.I’m trying to use this in a passthough / bare-metal situation, how do i verify that it’s actually \"working\"  So far just by watching perfom i’v seen no evidence it’s actually doing anything.HiThanks for the URL.In terms of performance, features, flexibility and management, Citrix will provide a much better experience overall.Do your users have any USB peripherals to consider? Things like a 3D SpaceMouse (3Dconnexion) etc? RDP won’t pass those through into the RDSH session.As it’s Passthrough and you want \"Graphics\" (not \"Compute\") you still need the Graphics driver. This is only available from within the NVIDIA Portal and needs to be licensed. You can register for a 90 day evaluation to gain access to it from here: Virtual GPU (vGPU) Software Free 90Days Trial | NVIDIAAs for validating whether the GPU is being used, you can use a GPU monitoring tool. My favourite is one called GPUProfiler. It’s created and maintained by a friend at NVIDIA and is available from here: Releases · JeremyMain/GPUProfiler · GitHubAs you’re focusing on one application, what’s the physical spec of the server? (CPU, RAM, Disk)RegardsMGgetting the licensed driver did the trick, thanks for the help!i’m just using the driver from nvidia’s website, is there a special licenced driver that i need?HiYes, there is a specific driver you need for vGPU. If you don’t already have access, you can register for an evaluation here: NVIDIA Enterprise Account RegistrationOnce approved, you’ll then be granted access to the Portal where you can download the License Server and vGPU Software.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

On both servers I have set up the local policy to use hardware for remote desktop services.

I have tried with RemoteFX and without it but I am not getting the licensing from the server even I reserved the licenses by MAC.How can I get the full experience for my VDIs? what I am missing? do I need install any nvidia driver / software over the Windows 10 image? what other configuration I need to deploy to deliver graphics experience over my 10 VDI W10 pool?I have deleted and created the VDIs 15 times, trying all the options, configuring policies on the hosts… updating the last nVIDIA software realease… but…not working…Please, could you help me?Thank you very much for your help and time in advance.\\nPabloSo what’s the issue? Everything works as expected.

you’re running the most up to date version. That takes care of that.Once the driver has been reinstalled, make sure vCenter is still configured to \"Shared Direct\". Now that side of the install is taken care of and there’s no need to revisit it.Have you made any changes to the Server BIOS? If no, please review these articles to make sure your BIOS is configured correctly:NVIDIA Support Article: Incorrect BIOS settings on a server when used with a hypervisor can cause MMIO address issues that result in GRID GPUs failing to be recognized. | NVIDIAUse Page 23: https://images.nvidia.com/content/pdf/vgpu/guides/vgpu-deployment-guide-horizon-on-vsphere-final.pdfPlease also confirm that you are running Enterprise Plus licensing on your vSphere Hosts?

Help…\\nRegardsHiOk, great. So you’re running the correct vGPU driver and you’re running the correct vSphere licensing. There’s no need to change anything there again. Forget about them and look at other areas.The BIOS is a really important step. I’m not saying it’s the issue, but it could certainly cause an issue and does need to be set correctly if it isn’t already. Do you not have any out of band management for the Server hardware? Is there no way to remotely get to the BIOS on server boot? How do you remotely power it on? No remote management Console to watch it’s progress?Regarding vCenter, first I want you to double check something …1: Log into vCenter as administrator.\\n2: Locate the vSphere Host that has the T4 installed and select it.\\n3: In the centre, click Configure, under Hardware select PCI Devices.\\n4: In the tab that says Passthrough-enabled devices, make sure the T4 is not listed here.\\n5: If it is listed here, it must be removed. Click All PCI devices and Configure Passthrough. Scroll down and unselect the T4 (there are multiple T4 options in here, none of them should be selected).\\n6: Reboot the Host afterwards.\\n7: Once rebooted, using the above steps ensure that the T4 is no longer showing in the Passthrough-enabled devices.Now follow these steps:1: Log into vCenter as administrator (if you aren’t already).\\n2: Locate the vSphere Host that has the T4 installed and select it.\\n3: In the centre, click Configure, under Hardware select Graphics.\\n4: You now have 2 Tabs (Graphics Devices and Host Graphics), select Host Graphics.\\n5: Select the Edit tab to the right.\\n6: In the Window that opens there are 2 sets of 2 options, at the moment you’re only interested in the tops ones (Shared and Shared Direct). You must select Shared Direct.\\n7: Reboot the vSphere Host. Once it comes back up, using the steps above make sure that Shared Direct has been accepted and is still set.\\n8: Connect to the Host using SSH and run nvidia-smi vgpu. If vGPU is available, it will list the T4.Try that and see how you get onRegardsMGHi MG,This project is in POC stage and then, unfortunetly, I don’t have the IPMI (supermicro) or IDRAC (HP) to remotely get the bios.For the other point, I don’t have vcenter (I won’t be able to install it on my windows 10). Then I just can use the hypervisor web-UI and then, I didn’t find with that interface, the way to configure hardware PCI-device (that was what I said when I told about the shared direct; I’m not sure to have activated later…).Is there a way to do so using the web-UI ? And if not, how can I install vCenter on my windows 10 ?Thanx\\nRegardsJohnapparently, vSphere client is no longer available for ESX later than 6.0 and I’m using 6.7 version…only the web-UI version…HiYou need vCenter for vGPU.I don’t mean any offence, but it sounds like you’ve not used VMware before, or at the very least are not familiar with it or its components. With that in mind, as you’ve mentioned this is urgent, I would strongly advise that you forget about using vGPU and just use the T4 in Passthrough to a single RDSH VM and give all users access to that. That’s the quickest way to build a usable VM and give multiple users a platform to work from (if that is your objective). You can get vCenter installed and look at vGPU after that’s done when your users are working.Passthrough doesn’t need vCenter and you can configure that directly on the vSphere Host. If this is an acceptable alternative, then reverse the steps I mentioned above about checking for Passthrough-enabled devices. Please note, that the T4 will still require a license in Passthrough, so make sure you have the NVIDIA License Server up and running.If you still want to go down the vGPU route, then you will need vCenter. In which case, deploy it on another physical Server in your environment. Download the vCenter .iso, this will then allow you to deploy a vCenter VSA to your other Server, but you’ll need to know how to configure it.As you’re unfamiliar with VMware and you’ve stated this is a priority, I would advise you just run the T4 in Passthrough and go down that route for the time being, unless there is a specific reason for wanting vGPU in the current situation.RegardsMGHi MG,To be perfectly clear, the POC was already done but using a KVM hypervisor. Before to deploy it in production stage, the company-IT ask us to do the same but with VMWare. We have to create a windows 10 vm, using vGPU, give the result to IT-team which will configure it in term of security group compliance for the next deployment (we are planing to deploy 15 vm on theses 3 ESX server). As you say, I’m not familiar with vmware (and actualy our ESX experts have just litle knowledge on grid and vGPU, unfortunetely…).\\nBut I don’t want to give up this project. The goal is to give the oportunity to our coleague to start specific applications (gaz industry) and to use kind of VNC (DCV actually) to see the screen on their computers.I will try the vCenter way… Many thanx for your advises.JohnHi, I already advised to check your vCenter settings in my first post. If you are not familiar with VMWare it is very hard to give you proper advise.HiThe reason I suggested using Passthrough for now, is because as you’re unfamiliar with VMware (which is no problem at all, there’s plenty of technologies I’m unfamiliar with) it will be the quickest way to give your users access to a GPU accelerated desktop and allow them to work, albeit from the same RDSH VM. While they’re working on that RDSH VM, you can then look at how you install and set up vCenter and then in the background, build the Windows 10 VMs that you’ll migrate them to, rather than give them nothing in the short term until you’ve resolved this issue.This approach is the easiest and quickest way to bring up service :-)When you say \"gaz industry\", which Applications are your users running? Petrel? Kingdom? …RegardsMGPetrel, Techlog, eclipse, gocad … (Petrel is a very graphical consuming !)HiVery interesting …Depending on how your testing goes, you may want to seriously consider looking at other GPUs. Although it may work, the T4 isn’t really suited to seismic interpretation or eclipse runs, and certainly not with multiple users running on it.Personally, I’ve found Petrel to be CPU limited, so it’s worth making sure you have plenty of high speed CPU Cores for each VM as well, but I guess this depends on your workflow and which modules you’re using.The minimum GPU I’d be looking at for these type of workloads would be a P40, then either an RTX 6000 or 8000 if you need more performance than that. If you’re doing more Computational processing than 3D, then a V100 / V100S may be a better option than an RTX (although a V100 / V100S will do a great job with 3D as well if needed, and an RTX will do a great job with Computational, but they do have their more specific use cases). Obviously once vCenter is sorted and you’re able to use vGPU, you can put multiple users on all of those so they’re not a 1:1 relationship.How are you testing the performance? Seagull?RegardsMGHi all,Thanx for the advices M.G !News:\\nI deployed a vCenter on my ESX-1 using a windows vm and, I’m now able to configure the Shared Direct and, I now access to the vGPU on my vms (!)Many thanks to both of you !\\nAll the Best\\nJohnHi.Im running ESX 6.7 on QuantaGrid D52G-4U which is compatible with Tesla T4 installed on it.\\nI tried all the steps mentioned in the thread, but still can’t make it work properly.Errors that I have:Theis is also missing PCI Devices menu item in the vCenter esx host Configure Tab.Do you have any idea what could be wrong?HiNot sure what you plan on using the 1A profile for?, but have you enabled SRIOV in the BIOS and enabled Above 4G decoding?RegardsMGHi.Yes, SRIOV and 4G decoding are enabled.You need to enable IOMMU (AMD) or VT-d (Intel) in the BIOS; SRIOV is for something else.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

It seems that my “Version of Windows” cannot detect my current graphics card which I’m using for several years now. It’s only this time that I updated my Windows and afterwards the graphics card isn’t working already. I tried to play one of my games and I kinda noticed that I’m not playing it the way it was supposed to be smooth back then. Then I checked that the only CPU/GPU that was named after is “Intel” which isn’t my graphics card.I checked my Device Manager and found out that my Display Adapter only shows Intel. When I ticked “Show Hidden Devices” I saw that my NVIDIA graphics card appeared but isn’t enabled. I right clicked it and it only shows Update Driver or Uninstall. There isn’t any option of Enable/Disable. I tried to press the “Update Driver” and it does nothing so what I did was, I uninstalled the device from Device Manager and tried to download the same driver that I know. Then soon after, upon installing, it says that it isn’t compatible with the version of Windows.I tried almost everything that I found from the internet. My recent activity was I used DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) via Safe Mode and tried to reinstall the driver. But it still hasn’t solve the problem. So I tried to reach out to NVIDIA customer service but then I found this forum. I’ve been stressed out for weeks just for my graphics card to work again. I hope you could help me out.

       " 'assigning-multiple-vgpus-to-one-vm': 'Hi All,I’ve got a Tesla M10 on my Windows Server 2019 VM, with a vDWS license installed.I was under the impression I could assign 2 vGPU’s to 1 VM so as to allocate extra resources for Solidworks when the vDWS license was used.However, the 2nd vGPU has an ! on it in Device Manager with an error on it \"This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use. (Code 12)If you want to use this device, you will need to disable one of the other devices on this system.\"The only other device is the other M10.  I’ve disabled the Hyper-V Video Driver.I can install the driver again, then reboot and then the behaviour is the same.Have I done something silly?Thanks in advance for your help.HiNot sure why you’d want to do that … Solidworks can’t use more than 1 GPU.Solidworks is typically CPU limited (not GPU). So if you need more performance, you mainly need a faster CPU. Also, it’s single threaded, not multi-threaded so hopefully you have a CPU that at the very minimum has a 3.0Ghz base clock. If Solidworks is your main application, then 3.3Ghz or above would be a better choice.Which version of Solidworks are you using? Reason for asking, I believe it was Solidworks 2019 that had a bit of a rework to improve performance, so make sure you’re running the latest version if possible :-)RegardsMGHi sorry for the delay.  We’re running SW 2020.OK I must have misunderstood a different article about it.  I was under the impression you could basically utilise the resources of 2 vGPU’s as 1, thus increasing the power.We’re running AMD EPYC 7351 CPU’s at a clock speed of 2.9Mhz.  Maybe that’s the cause of the lagging.HiYou can run more than 1 vGPU, but the application needs to support it. Also, there are different ways of presenting more than 1 GPU to a system / application. As you’re running Hyper-V, you’re not actually using vGPU anyway, you’re using Passthrough (referred to by Microsoft as DDA (where a whole GPU is allocated to a VM, rather than a portion of it)).Application lag can be caused by many things. BIOS, choice in Hardware, Hypervisor settings, Storage, Network, Protocol, Operating System, Application Configuration, Data Size etc etc.What is it in Solidworks that’s laggy?RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

A list of compatible servers are here: Virtual GPU Certified Servers | NVIDIA GRIDIt’s not, but does it matter that much? vDGA and everything else for VMware works.It matters because it is not clear if the issue is because of a incompatibility between your hardware; the T4 and the vGPU software.  We work with OEMs/VMware etc to give buyers confidence that their hardware platform is compatible with vGPU and the T4 will run without error.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'holiday-mystery-v100-vgpu-grid-proveout-fails-cannot-create-cuda-contexts-alloc-memory-on-most-cuda-sample-kit-entries-vmware-rhel-cuda10-2': 'Interesting holiday mystery: We are helping an org prove out GPUs in their data center, and while nvidia-smi successfully runs, any basic creation of a CUDA context / cudaMalloc fails.  We suspect it’s around the vGPU  setup, as our reference setup works on a google cloud RHEL 8.x node w/ similar install flow.We’re unsure where to go from here, so any ideas welcome! It’s hard for us to move non-docker / packaged items to host, so if diagnostics ideas, ideally ones we can containerize. (Ex: we got cuda sample tests running via nvidia docker, but hard outside docker b/c rhel makes it hard to get the old gcc7 installed.)Some lingering ideas:\\n– maybe 2Q is the wrong size? or we’re using the wrong license type?\\n– are there bios settings we need to check/tweak?\\n– maybe there is a way to test the cuda context at the hypervisor/rhel level that isn’t hard (e.g., no need for porting gcc toolchain)?=====It’s a tricky yet standard enterprise env, so we’d like to get this figured out as a template for future apps:\\n– V100 GPU\\n– esxi 6.7\\n– rhel 8.3\\n– vGPU 10.4 driver bundle (=> 440.121 vGPU manager +  440.118 linux driver)\\n– testing vGPU partition of size 2Q for headless compute tasks (CUDA → nvidia rapids)\\n– license manager is still being setup: we tried setting as Type 0 (unlicensed) and 1, 2\\n– docker w/ nvidia runtime set as default (docker 19.04, same versions as work on another rhel 8.3 gpu node)Some diagnostics so far:Errors are generally:440.118.02 / 440.118.02 / 10.2\\n0 GRID V100-2QP0, 2GB partition w/ 160MB allocated, but missing temp/wattage  we see in the hypervisor’s nvidia-smiMore nvidia-smi details:display mode enabled\\ndisplay active disabled\\npersistence mode enabled\\naccounting mode disabled\\ndriver model: current/pending n/a n/a\\nvbios 00.00.00.00.00\\nmultigpu board: no (single gpu test node)\\ngpu part: n/a\\ngpu virt mode: vgpu\\nhost vgpu mode: n/a\\nproduct name: quadro virtual data center workstation\\nlicense status: unlicensed\\npci bus 0x02\\ngpu link info n/a\\necc mode enableddocker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all nvidia/cuda:10.2 nvidia-smi./bandwidthTest\\nStarting…\\nRunning on…\\nDevice 0:…\\nQuick ModeCUDA error at bandwidthTest.cu:686 code=46 (cudaErrorDevicesUnavailable) “cudaEventCreate(&start)”./reduction\\n./reduction Starting…\\nGPU Device 0: “Volta” with compute capability 7.0\\nUsing Device 0: GRID V100-2Q\\nReducing array of type int\\n16777216 elements\\n256 threads (max)\\n64 blocksCUDA error at reduction.cpp:492 code=46 ) cudaErrorDevicesUnavailable) “cudaMallo((void**)&d_idata, bytes)”b) numba/cupy/cudf/etc fail on context / memory creation:from numba import cuda\\ncuda.current_context() #failsHiThe “Q” Profiles (QvDWS (Quadro Virtual Datacenter Workstation)) are the highest license tier and give the maximum functionality available. However you may also want to use the “C” Profiles (vCS (Virtual Compute Server)) as these are specifically for Compute focused workloads. They’re considerably cheaper and they’re licensed per GPU, not Per User like all other licenses. You can run up to 8x VMs on the same GPU with a single vCS license and they may be more appropriate for your workloads. However for the time being “Q” will be fine.I’m not sure why you’re running vGPU 10.4? The 10.x branch is only supported until December 2020, meaning you have 3 days (at time of writing) of potential support remaining. If you use the current branch of 11.x (11.2 is most recent), this is an LTSB that runs to 2023 (not that you’d want to stay on the same driver for that long mind). 11.x also supports CUDA 11.0.What you’re experiencing is correct, the CUDA version is not listed in the Hypervisor as CUDA workloads aren’t run from there. You’re installing a GPU manager in the Hypervisor, not an actual driver (of sorts), which is why you can see the CUDA version within the VM, as the VM driver contains CUDA.The 2Q (2GB) Profile … You can of course use a 2GB Profile (if 2GB framebuffer is sufficient for your workload), however, depending on how many VMs you plan to run, you may benefit from changing the Scheduler mode to one that allows more consistent resource scheduling. Compute workloads are typically quite intensive, the Default Scheduler (Best Effort) will try and service all processing requests as they come in and for 3D / Graphical workloads it does a pretty good job, however it can easily become overloaded with multiple consistently high processing requests which will lead to inconsistent processing times, so perhaps switch to “Fixed” or “Equal” share mode to give more predicable performance. If you were running an A100, then this would be a different conversation due to MIG and SR-IOV.Regarding CUDA performance, again, what you’re experiencing is correct. You need to get it licensed and then it will start to work. There is a severe drop off in functionality when the vGPUs are not licensed. Licensing should be the first element that is completed when deploying a vGPU environment as obtaining production licenses can sometimes take a while and cause delays. Evaluation licenses on the other hand are pretty quick to get hold of and if you are facing delays, you can get those yourself by signing up for a 90 day evaluation here: NVIDIA Enterprise Account Registration.Hope that helpsRegardsMGWanted to report we’re good now, this helped. It looked like the base issue was misunderstanding what it meant for degraded performance for unlicensed mode during setup. The app uses CUDA, and unlicensed mode full disables CUDA, vs degrading it, hence failed context creation. It was fine once we got licensing up!Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",
       " 'nvidia-grid-vgpu-mouse-problems': 'We are trialling NVIDIA Grid vGPU applications using VMWare (7) and Citrix vAPPS (1808). When running a VDA based on windows 10 (which we have to do for a supported engineering environment) the mouse only lines up if you set local resolution to 800x600 - all other resolutions do not line up. This isn’t an issue with windows server 2016/2019 VDAs and is also not an issue with the Windows 10 VDA when we don’t use the NVIDIA card.The issue is present with single and multi-monitor setups.NVIDIA Driver version is 462.31\\nRTX Desktop manager 201.66\\nNVIDIA WMI 2.36.0Has anybody got any advice to resolve the issue?Which vGPU profile do you use? Does it also happen with RDP? Never seen such an issue yet.Regards SimonI’m having this same issue as well, setting the endpoint to a lower resolution like 1280 x 1024 corrects the mouse alignment issue, but that isn’t a permanent fix.  It seems there is a scaling issue when using vApps licensing on Windows 10, did you find a solution to your issue?  I have also testing the same scenario with Windows Server 2019 and it does not have this issue, it seems isolated to Windows 10 current and older builds (21H2, 21H1, 20H2)Hi, this is pretty simple to explain. You are not allowed to use vApps on Win10. You need to use vPC for client OS. The vApps profile is preventing misusage and therefore has the 1280x1024 restriction on the console session.Regards SimonI can confirm my issue was resolved when we used the correct license.Kind regardsBenPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'gpu-a40-passthrough-poor-performance': 'Hello everyone,I am facing some issues with my A40 GPU while gaming. Currently, I have set up a vGPU with flavor A40-8Q, but the performance is quite poor. It appears that the FPS is capped. I’ve tried changing the vGPU flavor, but it did not improve the performance. I’ve also used ‘frame_rate_limiter=0’ to uncap the frame rate, but it did not help.To address this, I decided to pass the entire GPU to a Windows 11 VM. However, I’m encountering problems while installing the driver. The installation process does not complete, and after a forced reboot, the VM fails to boot up.At this point, I’m not sure what to do to either enhance the vGPU’s performance or successfully pass the GPU to the VM.If anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate them. Thank you.Hi,\\nwhich Hypervisor is in use? FRL off should do the trick. I guess something didn’t work with the FRL off otherwise you should see >60fps. Please simply try to run a benchmark like Unigene Heaven to check if the GPU renders more that 60 fps.regards\\nSimonHi.Thank you for your reply. It sent me down a new rabbithole of testing.\\nI am using Ubuntu 22.04,  qemu:7.0, nvidia: 510.108.03.After running the benchmarks like you suggested, I saw an increase of almost 2x fps.\\nExactly the result I was expecting. I’ve updated qemu and nvidia driver between the tests. This could have had the desired effect.I’ve been playing around with different schedulers.\\nCould you tell me what is the difference between EQUAL_SHARE and FIXED_SHARE schedulers?\\nI see a drop to ~20fps during benchmarks. I’ve used both the default values and 1ms time slices.Also is there a way to slice cuda cores to vGPU. I mean just like vram, is there a way to have a dedicated number of cuda cores for each vGPU?Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'which-gpu-licenses-setup-for-rdsh': 'Hi!Could anyone recommend a setup for delivering 6 to 10 concurrent graphics-accelerated RDSH Desktop Sessions (Windows Server 2019) which are intended to watch 720p videos with media player from the WAN. No cinema quality is needed; the users should be able to understand what’s happening. Videos show 2 people sitting and talking in a room, no big movements.e.g.Are the vApps licenses the right choice, even if desktops have > 1280×1024 resolution?Or One\\n3. Bare-Metal RDSH with Quadro P4000 or M4000 (no licenses?)Your help is very much appreciated as I didn’t quite get the answer from the other topics.HiYes, vApps licenses are the correct choice for the M10 and T4.If it were me, I’d use the T4 in Passthrough. It’s a much more modern GPU with better encoding / decoding capabilities, and has plenty of Framebuffer for a single VM with multiple users.If you wanted to skip the vApps licensing (not that it’s expensive anyway), you could use an RTX4000 (instead of the M4000 or P4000). It has the same benefits of being a more modern GPU with better capabilities than the earlier architectures. No need to do that bare-metal, you can still run that in a VM as Passthrough. The downside to those GPUs, is they only have 8GB of Framebuffer, whereas the T4 has 16GB if you ever needed it.Framebuffer is typically the limiting factor when running RDSH when maximum user density is reached.RegardsMGHi MrGrid,thank you very much!I have one more question concerning CPU requirements when using GPU in this case:Is it better to use more cores with lower speed (e.g. Xeon-Gold 6240, 2.6 GHz) or less cores with higher speed (e.g. Xeon-Gold 6234, 3.3Ghz)?We would prefer lower speed / more coresHow many vCPUs would you assign to the T4-assigned VM with 10 video users?(I know the question does not directly concern the GPU but this might be the best place to ask anyway…)Thanks!RegardsWaleHi WaleTypically you’d want a higher Clock as that helps the entire platform, not just the VM, but you also need to take into account what else is running on the VM and also Hypervisor, so it’s always a trade off. If your system isn’t fully loaded, you could always populate just a single CPU Socket and use a Xeon Gold 6254 which has 18 Cores @ 3.1Ghz. Then if you need more CPU at some stage, buy another and scale up.Start with 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM and a T4 and scale resources up / down accordingly. Storage wise, you should be running Flash, not spinning disk. If you wanted a cheap, fast, storage solution, you can run M.2 drives on a PCIe carrier board.RegardsMGHi, MrGRID\\nCould you be so pleasure to explain how to divide one T4 onto 8 vGPU under Windows Datacenter Server 2019 with Hyper-V role installed to passthrough them into VMs under such server?\\nLicense server is installed.HiHyper-V doesn’t support vGPU. Passthrough (DDA) is your only option.Depending on how many and also the type of graphics workloads you may want to run in the future, you would do well to look at changing your Hypervisor for those workloads. If you only have RDSH workloads, then sticking with Hyper-V and Passthrough may be sufficient, but if you need to do anything more than that, then you’ll need to change Hypervisors.Hyper-V is currently the least favourable Hypervisor for graphics workloads. vSphere, XenServer, Acropolis and even KVM would all be a more suitable choice at the moment should you wish to look at changing.RegardsMGWhen enabled on Tesla GPUs, licensed editions of GRID Virtual Workstation or Virtual PC are activated by obtaining a license over the network from an NVIDIA GRID License Server. The license is “checked out” or “borrowed” at the time the Virtual Machine (VM) is booted, and returned when the VM is shut down.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

No Citrix Policies have been created and only the default ones are applied.Which version of Workspace App are you using?RegardsMGHi @MrGRIDI already figured it out, I was applying some ctxhooks via a reg file I gathered a while ago from a master image with VDA 7.15 installed.That being said, the grey screen issue is already resolved.Thanks a lot for the follow up and support.Any thoughts on the high memory consumption by the ctxgfx service?HiApply your registry settings via GPO, it’s easier to review and keep track of what’s being applied when you upgrade your VDA or Operating System.Regarding the memory leaks, the only advice I can offer is to make sure you’re running the latest software throughout your stack. The 2003 VDA is now available, upgrade to that in combination with vGPU 10.1 and see if that helps.RegardsMGHi @MrGRID,Quick question…As I mentioned earlier, we are assigning M10-1B vGPU profiles to these Windows 10 VDIs.These users are using Windows-based thin clients with 2 x monitor @1080p. They are office power users that pretty much use enterprise apps, but they rarely run multimedia stuff such as YouTube, video conferences, and video training. On top of that, we use Pi-Hole to block ads and push ad-blockers extensions/add-ons to their browsers.I used the following guide as a reference:\\nhttp://images.nvidia.com/conten  t/pdf/grid/guides/vgpu-profile-sizing-guidance-for-windows-10.pdfBased on your experience, would it make sense to upgrade their vGPU profiles to M10-2B?HiUnfortunately this isn’t an answer anyone else can give you, as your environment specifications, applications, user working habits and therefore overall utilisation will vary to anyone else’s. You’ll need to monitor the utilisation on a subset of your VMs and decide what’s appropriate. Here’s my favourite utility for this kind of thing: Releases · JeremyMain/GPUProfiler · GitHub It’s nice and easy to understand, just capture the metrics for a group of users (the more the better) and take appropriate action based on the results. Other tools are available if you wanted to dive a bit deeper.If you increase the vGPU Profile size, at best, you halve the density of the GPU potentially doubling your overall Server hardware requirement, unless you have some headroom built-in.This is why it’s absolutely critical to run well defined POCs before the hardware specifications that will be used are finalised. If unsure, it’s far better to over-spec than under-spec the environment. I’ve seen it happen before in an environment where the customer used the the wrong vGPU Profile and it worked out very, very expensive for them to put right.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",
       " 'chromebooks-and-nvidia-grid': 'Hello everyone,I come here because Citrix and NVidia have both been struggling to provide me with any concrete information. We’re trying to get dual monitors working for chromebooks, with hardware encoding enabled for our GPU setup. We are hoping to utilize hardware encoding for the entire screen, rather than selective h.264. This works fine when launching a single monitor Citrix session, however if we full screen it across 2 or more monitors it does not work. They are simple 1080p monitors and this issue happens across multiple chrome devices including i5 cpu chromebooks, chromeboxes, etc.Our setup:\\nDelivery controller: LTSR 7.15.300\\nVDA: 1906\\nWindows OS: 1809 x64\\nNvidia driver version: 9.1 on both host and guest\\nImaging: Image created through app layering, and published with MCS (static persistent desktops). I am using the platform layer for nvidia drivers, then installing the vda afterwards. There is an app layering nvidia fix we also perform prior to installing the drivers (regarding unifiltr) registry key.\\nGPU: Tesla T4 Turing 16gb GPU, 2 in each host.I am at a loss as to what to try. We have played with google policy and used the chrome configuration utility from citrix:Citrix Workspace app (earlier known as Citrix Receiver) for Chrome and HTML5 Configuration UtilityThis works fine from a windows endpoint, but dual monitors I cannot get working from any kind of chrome device. This is really preventing us from moving forward with our POC and any help would be greatly appreciated.So what should NV do there? As you already mentioned it works fine on fat client so not a NV issue. Citrix receiver has not the same feature set for different platforms so I assume it is a limitation with Citrix receiver. At least there is nothing from NV side that would prevent dual screen on Chrome.regards\\nSImonHiIn addition to Simons answer (which is correct), the issues you’re experiencing are why it’s so important to run POCs before rolling out a new environment or set of technologies. Trying different configurations of hardware, software etc until you find what works and what’s acceptable for your support teams and more importantly end users. This is where you find the various limitations of each technology or combination of technologies and it’s all part of the process. You can then either accept those limitations and carry on, or decide if you go down another route substituting different technologies until you get the functionality that you need.For example:Is using the GPU for encoding the protocol critical to the success of the POC at this time? If no, try using the CPU (server side) by changing the Citrix Policies appropriately and see if that works for your users.If hardware encoding is critical, is having multiple monitors? How about removing a pair of low resolution 1080P monitors and replacing them with a single 4K monitor? This will free up desk space, remove cables and free up power sockets as well as giving your users much more screen estate to work with. It will also give you some future proofing, which 1080P doesn’t. And as you’ve already confirmed, your POC works with a single monitor …You’ve already mentioned that other non-Chrome devices work, are you locked in to using Chrome as an OS?This is 100% a Citrix limitation or Citrix / Chrome configuration issue. The GPU is more than capable of encoding multiple monitors (or a single 4K monitor ;-) ). There is nothing on the NVIDIA side that can be done here.Have you posted on the Citrix Forums? If no, you should be posting under these categories:https://discussions.citrix.com/forum/1316-xendesktop-7x/https://discussions.citrix.com/forum/523-gpu-technologies/Lastly, I haven’t used XenDesktop 7.15 for a long time, I always run the CR to take advantage of the latest settings, but it may be worth checking which Citrix Policies are available in the LTSR vs CR in case there’s something in there that helps. Unrelated, but whenever I’m working with customers and they’re using vGPU / GPU technologies, I always recommend running CR, not LTSR. It may or may not be applicable in your case, but worth having a look just in case.RegardsMGUnderstood and thanks for the feedback. Yes, we’re still in the POC phase luckily. I think what I’m most disappointed with is the fact that neither Nvidia nor Citrix can definitively say where the limitation is. No one has given us any advice other than the standard documentation, no one can say whether it is a limitation of chromebooks, Receiver for Chrome, or anything else. I can see where it would be easy for Nvidia to say that it works on a fat client, so it isn’t an Nvidia issue. It makes sense, and I understand that.We’re really hoping to get the NVENC offloading working as that seems to be the best use of the GPU’s. When the hardware encoding isn’t working, the performance when watching even a simple youtube video is on par with that of a regular VDI VM. There isn’t much benefit for buying these fancy video cards if they can’t offload CPU tasks to the GPU.Regarding what should NV do, it would be helpful if they atleast added this to their documentation so the next person that tries to do dual monitors on a chrome device, they can say it is a known limitation. Or perhaps NV could work with Google or Citrix to get this implemented if it is a limitation of Citrix or Chrome OS.I’m sure there is a number of things they could do, whether they will do them to try to sell hardware is another story. We’re an extremely large customer looking at buying easily 40-50 high end GPU’s, and anywhere from 4000-6000+ per user licenses, but I suppose this isn’t incentive enough to get any support beyond \"this is a citrix issue\".I suppose I’ll post on the Citrix forums to see what they can offer.HiThe GPUs and vGPU software are doing what they’re sposed to. They have the functionality and performance to encode multiple monitors (way more than two) per session or Client. The issue is with the combination of Citrix WorkspaceApp and Chrome, and that’s nothing to do with NVIDIA. You could use AMD GPUs and it still wouldn’t work, as it isn’t an AMD limitation either. You can see this because as you’ve mentioned above, the solution works with a Windows Operating System on a Client instead of Chrome. It isn’t because of NVIDIA that it works with Windows as the GPU is located in the datacenter so has zero visibility of the Client or its Operating System being used, it’s because of Citrix and Microsoft. Windows being the most popular Operating System globally moves it to the top of Citrix’s priority queue for feature development and support.Unfortunately, in this instance, an Operating System that isn’t widely used in enterprise environments (compared to something like Windows) is being used on the Client side, therefore feature development and configuration support will be lacking by comparison. There really isn’t anything NVIDIA can do here, their GPUs are working perfectly, are in no way at fault and there’s no need for NVIDIA to add it to any of their documentation, as it isn’t their limitation.Do you have the model number of a Chromebook you’ve selected for this POC that I can look at?… neither Nvidia nor Citrix can definitively say where the limitation is.I can understand the frustration when vendors are bouncing customers around. However, I will definitively say that it’s a Citrix WorkspaceApp & Chrome configuration or functionality issue.RegardsMGHey TylerMy company isn’t setup exactly like you are but we are running Chromebooks connected to Plugable USB-C docking stations running up to 3 monitors from a single Chromebook.  Our hardware consists of Dual Nvidia M10 Cards in our hosts and Asus C434, HP X360 14 G1, and PixelBooks.  What chromebooks are you trying this from?\\nAlso are you using the Citrix Workspaces from Chrome Web Store vs the playstore.Citrix Workspace app for Chrome OS\\nWe are currently on 7.15 CU4  and 1909 for the VDAs.And just read you post a for a second time and noticed we are setup different.  We have our graphics policies set to \"Use video codec when preferred.\"  I will test with changing it to  \"For the entire screen\" and will get back with you on our results.Hey TylerWelp…you are correct.  I get the same results as you.  If we change the Video Codec to \"For the Entire Screen to Optimize\" our Plugable USBC docks no longer work with our Chromebooks.  The Workspaces trys to open and then immediately closes.  If I unplug it from the dock the native screen works.  But then says Hardware Encode \"disabled\"  Our default policy was set to \"For Actively Changing Regions.\"  If I set this to \"Use Video Codec when Preferred\"  I get the same result as above.  If I set if to \"For Actively Changing Regions\" everything works again.  And this is only on Chromebooks.  I tested on a couple Mac Books and a couple Windows 10 machines and \"For the Entire Screen to Optimize\" works fine and hardware encode says \"Enabled\" with 4 monitors connected.  So looks like just chromebooks are not working.  We are actually finishing up a test environment that is running 1909.  This is to prepare for the next LTSR.  Maybe the behavior is fixed since 7.15 is a few years old now.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Quadro RTX6000 is supported in pass-through and you don’t need any additional software - such as vGPU to make it work.I am not familiar with Proxmax and how that works for virtual environments.  However, assuming that nvidia-smi is detecting the GPU correctly I assume the NVIDIA driver is working correctly.I suspect that your application is based on GLX and however you are remoting into the server is defaulting to CPU rendering.  I recommend running X11VNC on the server and see if that helps.:D:Yes, still trying to work this out.  Had some other issue pop-up but will be getting back to it shortly.I suspect that your application is based on GLX and however you are remoting into the server is defaulting to CPU rendering. I recommend running X11VNC on the server and see if that helps.That’s what I’m beginning to realize and looking for a way to run heavy graphic apps (like OBS) but use the GPU to render the desktop and the encoding work.  I was using Proxmox’s built in remote desktop (spice or novnc).  So, yeah, I guess all the desktop rendering was done on the host’s CPU. :/That said, I’m moving to try and use an LXC arrangement on proxmox rather than QEMU VM’s so I can have multiple, different apps/processes use the GPU simultaneously.\\n(eg. spin up a quick VM for someone to render a backlog of video content into more suitable formats, while other regular use LXC’s are using the gpu for object detection and what not…)I’ve got the drivers loaded on the host and I can spin up an LXC and install the same version of the drivers and SMI is happy.  Now I’m working on the apps part of the equation.But just so I’m clear, if I’m running a desktop environment (like Mate) in an LXC, can I have that desktop rendered/processed on the quadro?     (using a different remote desktop solution like X11VNC)\\nWhat are the tricks or need to knows?I’ve already found out the snaps don’t work well in LXC’s so not snap ffmpeg or OBS :(.  I’ll have to build my own ffmpeg.\\nLots of questions, sorry, but thanks in advance for your advise.\\nLHAs an update…\\nPassthrough is working great in LXC containers.  Running 2 different instances of OBS sharing the Quadro and it turns out it’s rendering the desktop as well.  I’m using NoMachine to initiate and access the required GUI Desktop.  That was a tricky setup but the Ubuntu-Studio distro has nearly all the pieces put together.\\nAlso, not necessarily for this forum, but a ray of hope, got the SNAP’s of ffmpeg to work in the containers so I didn’t have to compile from source.Now I’m moving on to adding object detection to the NVR (Zoneminder) running in a different container.  I need to get CUDA up and cuDNN.  So it looks like I’ll be starting over installing the CUDA toolkit on the host and containers as it includes the drivers needed to match throughout the whole system (host and containers).Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

However, this message is false since when you click the balloon and look at the license manager you see that the license server is present and valid.https://imgur.com/a/4jlGyzvaddendum: this happens when the user logs in and the system tray icons are loading. Perhaps this could be some sort of timing issue where the balloon checks too fast.Is there any way I could maybe remove the system tray icon completely as a workaround ?Hi ProfundidoIf you’re sure it’s getting a license, then you can create and set the following Registry Key to disable the Pop-up:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\NVIDIA Corporation\\\\Global\\\\GridLicensingType = REG_DWORD\\nKey = DisableSpecificPopups\\nValue = 1Use a GPO to set the Key so it’s easy to track and revoke if needed.RegardsMGKnown issue. Will be fixed in the next release. Be aware that this is only a \"cosmetic\" issue as the VM is properly licensed. As workaround you can use the Regkey mention by MrGRIDregards\\nSimonThx guys. I will try the workaround. I noticed indeed that functionality wise there are no problems but I cannot release a build update in which this balloon message happens since it will rain tickets with end user questions about it the next day.By the way, I had been wanting to disable the Nvidia system tray icon all together already before this license error because:The license management console seems not to be multi-user aware. If I click it -even as admin- another end user on the same Citrix server will typically get the actual management console to pop up in their Citrix Xenapp session where I won’t get to see it (unless I’m the only user on that server)End users are typically curious and tend to click this system tray icon in their Citrix Xenapp session, causing popup’s for someone else on the server to happen.Update: I set the reg key manually in the build (since it’s Hkey local) rather than through GPO and rebooted the machine but upon next login I saw the error again. This doesn’t seem to work. I rebooted the server twice to make sure my test was valid and doublechecked the key:https://imgur.com/a/08BLde0Hi ProfundidoI’m using the setting I listed in some of my deployments with vGPU 11 and it does work. Not sure why it’s not working for you though. Looks like you have it configured as required.Just for reference, there’s a list of useful vGPU registry settings available from here, including the removal of the license component from the Control Panel:https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/11.0/grid-licensing-user-guide/index.html#windows-registry-grid-license-settings__windows-registry-grid-license-settings-summaryRegardsMGThanks. That’s a useful overview of available switches.I had already tested using the fix from the other 2year old thread where we remove the icon completely and after testing that part seems to work. First login after rebooting I still saw a short flash after which the icon dissappeared but subsequent logins don’t see anything at all.I think I’ll use that for now as full workaround so I can release this build and experiment with other switches later.We are seeing the same issue as well and reg key to hide notifications does not work. NVIDIA, can you guys release some sort of intermediate client patch or workaround as its generating support calls?We are seeing the same issue as well and reg key to hide notifications does not work. NVIDIA, can you guys release some sort of intermediate client patch or workaround as its generating support calls?This exact value below in a build update of your golden image (or deploy through gpo) did the trick for me:[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\nvlddmkm\\\\NvTray]\\n\"StartOnLogin\"=dword:00000000Reboot after implementing or make your build go live and then test with multiple logins from different usersI have this set under current user SOFTWARE\\\\NVIDIA Corporation\\\\NvTray StartOnLoginThis seems to shorten duration of the message. It is still there, however, for the first user to logon to the machine.Havent tried disabling tray for the entire machine yet.Update: After I put my build in production today I too noticed that the error message still appears very briefly for the first person that logs in to that server (not for subsequent user logons) but since the icon is immediately removed it’s harmless now. People don’t have the time to even try clicking on it.For me personally that’s sufficient as a workaround. Note though that this is still using the workaround of completely removing the system tray icon for everyone. The original reg value that is supposed to only prevent the balloon popup message (without removing the system tray icon completely) doesn’t work for me either.Hi,we have the same error in our environment. Please get the fixed version released quickly.\\nI opened a support case about this and nobody told me that this is a known issue.Thanksfor anyone that follows this: I can confirm that since the latest drivers (452) that I just installed solved the problem for me.

They are not designed to work together or supported to do so.Certain Quadro and Tesla GPUs are designed for Professional and Enterprise use with vGPU. However, as you are using Hyper-V, unfortunately you can’t use vGPU at all (Hyper-V doesn’t support it), so you would have to use DDA (Passthrough) with the GPUs instead.

       " 'adding-gpu-to-existing-ucs-cluste': 'Hi Everyone,We currently have a UCS cluster of 8 HX220 servers running VMware Vsphere with Citrix for our VDI. The servers are a couple years old and recently I asked Cisco for a design to expand the cluster so we can add M10 cards. Every design they’ve come back with is a \"new\" cluster. When I asked why can’t I just add the GPU capabilities to the existing I was told it won’t work. The last design we had was adding 10 nodes with 2 M10 cards in each, so I would have to have one cluster for non-gpu workloads and the other for GPU. I mentioned well I could reduce the number of M10’s needed and I’ll purchase T4 cards for the exiting servers even if they don’t scale as well at least I’d have some GPU for the existing desktops on the existing cluster.I was advised that the hypervisor that virtualized the desktop (not the server) is where there is a limitation. This doesn’t make sense to me, has anyone any similar experience in this with Cisco UCS servers?Thanks for any insight if anyone can help.HiIf you’re using the M4 architecture then you’re completely out of luck, as the HX220 doesn’t support any GPUs, you’d need to use HX240, but be hugely limited on GPU options. If you’re using the M5 architecture then the HX220 will support either 1 or 2 T4s, so you could run 4 GPU accelerated XenApp Servers (splitting the T4s in half) or up to 32 XenDesktop VMs (assuming 1GB is enough framebuffer).As a heads up, unless M10s are already deployed in an environment and you’re looking to add additional GPU capacity with the same architecture (regardless of the OEM Server), I would strongly advise you (and anyone else) avoid purchasing them for a production environment at this point of their lifecycle and look at current generation GPUs. The T4 will scale as well as the M10, it’s just that the T4 has half the amount of Framebuffer, so you need 2 of them to equal a single M10s.If you’re going to retro fit GPUs into a Server, unless you’ve previously accounted for this with the specification when purchasing (which I’m assuming wasn’t done, otherwise the HX240 would have been used), it’s best to start clean. Installing GPUs typically requires larger PSUs and GPU enablement Kits (low profile CPU heat-syncs and custom power cables (as (certainly with Cisco) the GPUs have to be Passively cooled)) and sometimes different PCIe Riser configurations. CPU and Memory configuration is also a huge consideration due to the way in which the GPU changes the way resources are allocated. Although it can obviously be done, retro fitting GPUs into Servers that weren’t originally spec’d to run them is something I always try and avoid, and I’ll never recommend it (unless as mentioned, the Server had been correctly spec’d to accommodate GPUs after purchasing).My advice, take this opportunity and create a new Cluster with Servers that were correctly spec’d to support GPUs from the outset. A HX240 M5 will support up to 6 T4s, 3 times the density of the HX220 M5. One reason that Cisco may have come back with a 10 Server design, is because their 2U Servers only support 2 double wide GPUs, where as other OEMs support at least 3, which can make a huge difference to user density, architecture, licensing and overall cost.\"The Hypervisor that virtualised the desktop\" … So VMware then? I’m not sure which limitation they’re referring to, but ideally your Hosts in that type of Cluster should be the same GPU hardware. I’m assuming you’re using MCS / PVS?RegardsMGThank you very much for the detailed reply much appreciated. We are using the M5 architecture so our HX220’s can take 2 - T4’s each. We are going to try and run mostly hosted shared desktops off of Server 2016/2019 and only in use pooled desktops in use cases that absolutely need them.We use MCS, and Cisco’s designs are all M5 HX240 nodes for the \"new\" cluster and again I simply thought it would be a matter of adding the HX240’s into the existing cluster that would then allow us to provision GPU resources within. We thought even if our existing non-GPU \"task worker\" and moving some of those to the citrix cloud to free up CPU, RAM, and Storage if needed again just to add GPU. It is at this point that Cisco is saying there is a limitation of the desktop hypervisor, so they haven’t said it isn’t possible. I feel like I’m being oversold a bit, and although I understand a new cluster is a preferred design I’m trying to squeak as much ROI out the existing cluster thats all.We don’t know what size of frame buffer will work, we are post secondary institution so we are making assumptions based off of the physical spec’s of those programs that use software that requires GPU (AutoCad, Revit, ArcGIS). So we’re not entirely sure of the total amount of GPU horse power they’ll need for learning outcomes. We plan to start small and then scale if the user experience and performance demands it, but we need to start somewhere.So I didn’t want to retro-fit I completely ok with adding new nodes I just wanted to attach them to the existing cluster is all so to expand some GPU potentially those that already exist. Some of the existing use cases do have some small measure of application where GPU allocation may benefit their outcomes.Just for record the expansion we are planning going from starter assumptions is about 250 CCU that may end up with a 2GB FB and 200 CCU at 1GB. Because so many things are unknown of where this will need to scale that’s sort of our starting point in the expansion. Cisco has been very good and trying to respond based on requirements provided but I still feel I’m missing pieces to explain it to our management properly.One last thing, the M10’s are they due for a new generation or is the T4 that ? I understand the T4 2:1 ratio compared to M10’s I just thought it was more bang for the buck going with the M10 for density. However if they are going out soon then ya buying them now might make scaling in a year or 2 become tricky (new clusters again lol) if they are no longer available for sure.Again thank you for your reply it’s very helpful in helping me understand and additional comments are much welcomed.HiIs there an issue with creating a new Cluster? Apart from the requirement for a minimum amount of Hosts (I’m assuming you’re running Hyperflex) but you have that covered with Ciscos recommendation. The existing vCenter will run multiple Clusters so no complication there. Citrix will work across Clusters, just add the new location into Studio. I’m assuming you already have the correct vSphere licenses (Enterprise Plus) for your existing Cluster, but you’ll obviously need additional vSphere Enterprise Plus licenses for the new Cluster, unless you’re running (vSphere for Desktop). So I’m not initially sure what the issue is with creating a new Cluster, and it’s actually not a bad idea to have more than one …What are the Specs of your existing HX220 Hosts? (PSU Rating / CPU (Cores and Clock (or model number and I’ll look it up) / RAM / Disk / Network). Have you checked to see if you can fit 2 T4s in them (just to make sure 2 PCIe slots are available)?What’s meant by the \"desktop Hypervisor\"? Are they referring to VMware? I don’t see the relevance unless it’s out of date? Which version of vSphere / vCenter are you running?Which version of Citrix are you running? (MCS is my preferred method of deployment, glad you’re using it).Hosted Shared Desktops (XenApp) - Don’t use Windows 2016, it’s really old! If you’re building these XenApp VMs from scratch, then you should be using the latest version of Windows 2019. If you’re running “Microsoft Volume Licensing” then there’s an April 2020 fully patched version sitting on the VLSC Portal ready for use. Regarding XenApp VM specs, now that you’ve mentioned which applications you’re running, the M10 is no longer an option for you regardless of any Server. The Applications you’ve listed are also reliant on CPU Clockspeed, the higher the better and typically nothing less than 3.0Ghz, so make sure any new Server purchases have a 3.0Ghz+ Clock. You should be looking at the T4 at a minimum. Using vGPU, you’ll need the 8Q Profile (Not 8A) for each XenApp VM and you’ll get 2 of those per T4. This will require QvDWS licensing (because of your Applications), but as you’re an Educational facility, speak to your IT distributor and you will be able to get EDU pricing for the vGPU licenses (it makes a HUGE difference). The reason this is important, is that vGPU is licensed per CCU, so if you have 250 CCU, you’ll need 250 QvDWS licenses. And yes, you need QvDWS licensing with these applications, vApps won’t give the performance needed. Regarding CPU and RAM, assuming you have adequate resources and can retro fit 2 T4s into the HX220, you’re effectively splitting the Server into quarters to support 4 XenApp VMs. Start with the following specs for each VM and then modify 8 vCPU / 32GB RAM / T4-8Q. This spec will typically support 20 – 25 Users (sometimes more / less), but this is application dependant and the applications you’re planning to run are typically delivered using XenDesktop (Not XenApp) to give consistent performance, so your XenApp density will probably be lower, but it depends how the Applications are used. Start with those specs and see how you get on. The only vGPU options you have with XenApp are 8Q or 16Q. You wouldn’t go lower than 8Q due to Framebuffer limits, and 16Q would mean only 1 VM per T4.Pooled Desktops (XenDesktop) – Start with 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM and T4-2Q per VM. Scale up resources from there depending on requirements.I assume you know about the hard RAM allocation when running vGPUs? It’s fixed per VM and the entire amount is hard allocated on boot. This is one reason it’s important to spec the Servers correctly when purchasing with GPUs as it changes the way in which resources are used.Rather than let Cisco talk you into a new purchase at this point, you should be looking to run a POC for the XenApp and XenDesktop VMs so you know what size profiles you need (CPU / RAM / vGPU). Then you can spec your new Servers correctly to fit the maximum amount of Users on them and allowing a little headroom for future performance and additional application requirements. There’s nothing worse than buying a new platform to meet your current requirements, then in 6 months or a year later when new applications are installed, realising that you didn’t allow enough performance headroom to support them.What is your total planned CCU density for XenApp & XenDesktop? 10 servers sounds a lot just to support 250 CCU …Unless you have reasons for not wanting to, it actually makes sense to run multiple Clusters if you have the resources to do so, one for your XenApp VMs the other for your XenDesktop VMs. That way you keep better control of the resource allocation from each vSphere Host for a more consistent experience.Unfortunately I can’t comment on GPU EOL / EOS. All I’ll say is that it’s not a good idea to buy and build a new Server platform around a GPU that’s 4 years old. There are technical reasons why you wouldn’t want to use them as well due to their architecture. Basically, stick with the T4 as a minimum, design around that and you won’t go too far wrong.RegardsMGNo after your explanation I think that better sells the idea of a new cluster a little better. The original thought process I was under was basically in 2 pieces 1) KISS keep it simple, less provisioning of new VM hosts etc., 2) I wanted to understand why when sold a \"scalable\" solution originally how it could be so complex to access that original scalability model (that’s my own OCD kicking in there).The existing vCenter will run multiple Clusters so no complication there. Citrix will work across Clusters, just add the new location into Studio. I’m assuming you already have the correct vSphere licenses (Enterprise Plus) for your existing Cluster, but you’ll obviously need additional vSphere Enterprise Plus licenses for the new Cluster, unless you’re running (vSphere for Desktop). So I’m not initially sure what the issue is with creating a new Cluster, and it’s actually not a bad idea to have more than one …Good call we have standard licensing on the existing nodes right now so we’ll upgrade to Enterprise Plus. Your explanation makes sense to me and the idea of a new cluster based on that is no longer a bottle neck in my mind now.What are the Specs of your existing HX220 Hosts? (PSU Rating / CPU (Cores and Clock (or model number and I’ll look it up) / RAM / Disk / Network). Have you checked to see if you can fit 2 T4s in them (just to make sure 2 PCIe slots are available)?Each node is HX220c-M5sx, dual 2.6 6132 processors, 756GB (766) max ram, 6 x 1.8TB drives. I looked up the specs here https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/vgpu-certified-servers/#utm_source=shorturl&utm_medium=referrer&utm_campaign=grid-certified-serversSo its good for 2x T4 per node, and it looks like the HX240x M5 can take 6x per node ?Hosted Shared Desktops (XenApp) - Don’t use Windows 2016, it’s really old!

Regarding CPU and RAM, assuming you have adequate resources and can retro fit 2 T4s into the HX220, you’re effectively splitting the Server into quarters to support 4 XenApp VMs.We are definitely looking at server 2019 for brand new builds.Start with the following specs for each VM and then modify 8 vCPU / 32GB RAM / T4-8Q. This spec will typically support 20 – 25 Users (sometimes more / less), but this is application dependant and the applications you’re planning to run are typically delivered using XenDesktop (Not XenApp) to give consistent performance, so your XenApp density will probably be lower, but it depends how the Applications are used. Start with those specs and see how you get on.Those are spec’s now, except we are at 36GB RAM and don’t have a vGPU profile. Same mindset as you suggest need to try it and see what the real user experience is like and so on.you should be looking to run a POC for the XenApp and XenDesktop VMs so you know what size profiles you need (CPU / RAM / vGPU). Then you can spec your new Servers correctly to fit the maximum amount of Users on them and allowing a little headroom for future performance and additional application requirements.

We really don’t know our CCU count, we have around 500 physical workstations currently but the number of unique users is 4x times that amount but they are not all using them at the same time so this expansion to measure actual usage patterns is somewhat of a guessing game for us at this point as well.Unfortunately I can’t comment on GPU EOL / EOS. All I’ll say is that it’s not a good idea to buy and build a new Server platform around a GPU that’s 4 years old. There are technical reasons why you wouldn’t want to use them as well due to their architecture. Basically, stick with the T4 as a minimum, design around that and you won’t go too far wrong.I think you sold me, if the M10 is 4 years old it’s pretty sure it will be discontinued or replaced in short order vs the T4 which is from 2018.HiIf your HX240 Nodes are only running XenApp / XenDesktop VMs, then you can use \"vSphere for Desktop\" licensing, which is cheaper than Enterprise Plus, but you can only run desktop workloads on those vSphere Hosts. With vCenter you can use Standard licensing.The HX220 with a T4 will be ok for a small, controlled POC to understand initial utilisation and configuration and will give you a rough idea about what your new VM specs and Cluster configuration will look like. It may be that you decide to scale up, not out, in which case you might use the 16Q profile with 1 XenApp VM, making the XenApp VMs have a higher density but have fewer to manage over all. Framebuffer is typically what you’ll run out of first when sizing with 8Q vGPU profiles on XenApp, but you obviously have 2 of them compared to 1 16Q profile. It’s the same amount of physical resource, you’re just distributing it in a different way and it can impact user density so it’s worth investigating whether 2x 8Q VMs vs 1x 16Q VM works for you. The other advantage of having less VMs is Windows licensing, just something to be aware of depending on which Microsoft licensing model you use.The HX240 will support 6 T4s, but this obviously depends on PCIe Riser configuration and whether you’re running anything else in those PCIe slots. Another benefit of the HX240 are the additional storage configurations you can use due to having more onboard disk capacity.Regarding platform usage … If you look through (Citrix) Director history it will tell you your loadings. You’ll then have an idea of how many and when people use the platform. The other thing is how many Citrix licenses you have, that’s your Max CCU limit and will give you a hard number to work with. You could have a look through the Citrix User Profiles (I assume you’re running UPM), and see when the people last logged on, obviously making calculations to accommodate the way in which people are currently working (COVID).RegardsMGI really appreciate your advice, its been a good sounding board for me to figure my way through this initial decision. Yes we’re going to PoC, its about learning what we need to know then to expand up or out whichever makes sense.Thanks again, I’m sure I’ll have more questions in the future :)HiNo problem at all, glad it’s been a useful discussionBest of luck with the POC, please let us know how you get on!RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'hyper-v-server-2019-rdsh-farm': 'HiWe currently run a server 2019 RDSH farm and would like to start implementing dedicated graphics cards into our HPE ProLiant DL380’s.Requirements are to increase the user count on each VM by offloading load from the CPU for Chrome and Office applications, along with improving the look and feel of the RDSH session.These requirements might be unattainable as I have seen reference to max users/licenses on the M10 of 64, is this the case?Ideally we would be running 5-6 RDSH VMs ok each host, currently we average 20 users per RDSH.Our supplier is a bit un clear on how much and what we need to licence as well, so any help on that would be appreciated.Many thanksHiAs an example, depending on the type of applications and how they’re used, you should expect about 15-25 users per GPU on an M10 before framebuffer exhaustion. The M10 has 4x 8GB GPUs on it and you’d allocate 1 GPU per RDSH VM. The user density varies between deployments as applications and how they’re used vary, not to mention environment optimisations, monitors and resolutions etc all vary and they all impact framebuffer usage. 15-25 users per GPU would give you between 60-100 users per M10 which should be achievable.However, in any new GPU / vGPU deployment, I’d recommend the T4 GPU over the M10 due to the stage of their lifecycle (M10s were released in 2016). As has been shown many times and also with feedback on here to support it, it’s the 8GB of framebuffer that is typically the limiting factor when it comes to RDSH deployments, not the encoding or processing, meaning that the 8GB on the M10 isn’t really sufficient for modern and more importantly future RDSH deployments forcing customers to scale out their deployments and not up, hence my recommendation to avoid it for new installations, and go for the T4.As you’re using Hyper-V, you’ll need to use Passthrough (it doesn’t support vGPU), so if you went with the T4, you’d need multiple GPUs per DL380.Regarding licensing, you’d want to use \"vApps\". This is licensed per Concurrent User (not total user), so match it to your CALs and you should be fine.Which generation of DL380 do you have?How many concurrent users do you support in you RDSH environment?RegardsMGHiThanks for the reply.We have a mixture but predominently Gen10.Across the farm currently we are at around 1,000 users, with aspirations for 2,000 within two years.Ideally 30 - 40 users per RDSH VM, for this exercise to be worthwhile.So Host wise if running 5 x RDSH VM’s, based on 30 users per session would be 150 users per ProLiant DL380 host.We currently have 2 x 10GB NIC’s in the chassis as well.I had seen mentioned advice to look at Quadro GPU’s, as they don’t require licensing?HiGreat, thanks for the information!Depending on your Riser configuration, you can physically fit up to 3x M10s or 7x T4s per DL380 G10. Here’s NVIDIAs Certified Server URL that collates information from the Server OEMs: Virtual GPU Certified Servers | NVIDIA GRIDRetro fitting GPUs into any Server can raise complications with the original Server configuration. These can be things like CPU choice, PSU choice (of which there are prerequisites that must be met) and RAM, so you need to make sure you have all the requirements met before installing the GPUs. You will also need a GPU enablement Kit which is typically a pair of low profile CPU heatsinks (to provide adequate cooling for the GPUs as they’re Passive) and additional Power Cables for the GPUs that need them (depending on which GPUs you go for (M10s need one, T4s do not)).The licensing for vApps really isn’t expensive, and for your environment, I’m pretty sure you can’t avoid it due to the options available. Basically, the Quadro options you have won’t give you the density you need. The largest single slot Quadro is an RTX4000 (8GB), if you move to a 16GB Quadro then you’re looking at the RTX5000 which is dual slot, so you halve the density in your server vs a T4 which has the same amount of Framebuffer and much lower power requirements. If you go above that, you’re into RTX6000 / 8000 which is not suitable for this type of deployment.5x T4s per DL380 with 30+ users per RDSH should be very achievable (pending a small POC for application validation of course).When purchasing your new DL380s as you scale later, you may want to revise the specification (CPU / RAM / GPU) so that you can install more T4s to further improve that density.RegardsMGBrilliant advice MG, I will look into the T4’s, any ceiling (Max users) on users for T4’s or is it purely based on usage requirements? Trial and error.HiUnfortunately there are too many variables to give an accurate answer on that, and there is no hard limit with RDSH (a VDI deployment is obviously different). Things like the amount of monitors a user has and the resolution of those monitors make a huge difference (1080P vs 4K) both to Framebuffer utilisation but also encoding as well. The type (and version) of applications installed and how they are used (we’ve all seen users with many multiples of tabs open in a browser before) makes a big difference too. Operating System configuration and optimisation all plays a part.I’ve heard of RDSH numbers of 10 - 11 users maxing out 8GB on an M10 due to sub-optimal applications being used, and then others right up to 30 users on single 8GB M10. Everyone’s environment is different, so the end results are usually different.As an estimate in terms of absolute numbers, if you have the right type of applications installed, with a well optimised Operating System and users that behave themselves, then I’d be expecting over 40 users on a single T4. It’s also important to leave a little headroom on all components to give a consistent experience and level of performance. No environment runs well when it’s running at maximum utilisation, so find your maximum then dial it back about 10 - 15% per GPU / RDSH. Also, when you purchase new servers to scale your environment, I would be expecting better density due to a more optimised selection of components being chosen to work together (CPU / RAM / GPU / Storage).The numbers you’re asking for are very realistic, and a small POC is always the best way to make sure you’re making a positive change to the environment, and you only need 1x T4 to test initially which means the initial cost of the POC should be very low.RegardsMGUnderstood, appreciate the feedback.Will go for a T4 and see how we get on ???Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

          : NoneHi SSDYou need to have multiple (physical) GPUs to be able to use Multi-vGPU. So in your case, you’d need more than 1 T4 in your Server. You could then allocate 2, 3, 4 etc … T4-16* Profiles to a single VM.Even if it were possible, adding more than 1 vGPU from the same physical GPU wouldn’t do anything, as it’s the same physical GPU.Make sure you’re not confusing having Multiple GPUs on a single VM, vs Multiple VMs on a single GPU …RegardsMGAh ok, I’m used to the GRID K1 cards having multiple GPUs.So this solution we have bought cant present multiple vGPU’s to a single VM then, so this means we either buy more T4 cards to split up the processing or try to present other VMs to share the GPU, but as you say they will fight for contention/resources if both VM’s are hitting it at the same time correcct?So sounds like its not the preferred GPU card for this solution then, can you recommend card that would do what I’m asking of it?Hi MG, so the solution for us is to replace the single Tesla T4 card with 2 X RTX-5000 cards in the Host and simply do a direct pasthrough assignment presenting them to the 1 VM.Thanks for your assistance to date.Regards,\\nSSDPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'slow-performance-on-azure-vm-nvs12v3-with-nvidia-tesla-m60-8gb': 'Hello forum,looks like i´m very stuck here. I´m trying to run a VM in Azure with a Nvidia Tesla M60. The performance is hell (i think about 1-4 frames per second). I followed the Guidelines on how to enable the dedicated GPU but with no effort. I´m using Citrix Workspace (2109) to access the Windows 10 multisession. Wether i use RDP or bastion the problem stays, i did run a test on WebGL water, the performance is very low. Even on my Laptop with non-dedicated graphics the perfomance is compared to the VM very well.I´m using the Nvidia GRID driver from microsoft (471.83 for Server 2019), dxdiag shows the correct adapter (NVIDIA Tesla M60 instead of the Indirect Display Adapter).What is the problem here? I wanted to run some 3D, CAD-Application - but i have no luck using the M60. The Graphics utilization monitor always shows (Inactive), it seems that the dedicated GPU is not used at all.Can you post the output from nvidia-smi -q from within the VM? I’m wondering if the VM is properly licensed…==============NVSMI LOG==============Timestamp                                 : Thu Dec  2 12:30:06 2021\\nDriver Version                            :

Never did this and I don’t really know how this affects the OS.The Citrix-Support told me to disable it, but i see it´s for VDAs 2006 or later. I´m disabling it now.I´m using WDDM now. I look at the graphic status bar now, shouldn´t it say GPU:Nvidia?No idea.

They would typically require different Scheduler configurations for optimal performance, and unless you ran \"Fixed\" or \"Equal\", the Compute workload would more than likely impact the Graphical workload.

Hoping you can help!–\\nLucasHi LucasFor first time customers the PAK is now hardcoded into their registration form. They redeem it as a function of the registration process.For current customers who purchase additional licenses, the new entitlement will be available when they log into the portal.Basically, the days of manually adding PAK keys are now behind us and this is (or should be) a system automated process. So when purchasing additional licenses from your vGPU license partner, please ensure they use the correct details so that the licenses / PAK appears in the correct account. They should not be providing you with a PAK any more.As this is a system automated task, I believe it takes up to 24hrs for the PAK to appear so you can draw down licenses against it.Hope that helps!RegardsMGHi MG,Thanks for your reply. I’ll go back to the vendor and try to figure out what the issue is. Can you clarify if the link between the vendor (we use Dell Digital Locker) and the NVIDIA License Portal is just the email addresses? I can’t see anything else that links the two sites.LucasHi LucasYes, your email should be enough for the License Distributor to locate you (as it will be unique within the NVIDIA Portal) and allocate the additional purchases.I don’t have any personal experience using Dell Digital Locker, but I’ve heard of a few issues previously. Whether these issues have been caused by Dells system, customer error with supplying incorrect details, an understanding of the system or a combination of all of them, I’m unsure.Although this is an older post, it’s worth just having a look here for reference. Simon (from NVIDIA) details the steps required for the Dell Digital Locker, although this was when the PAK method was being used so there will be a difference here, but they should help guide you in the right direction and set expectations around processing time.https://gridforums.nvidia.com/default/topic/1176/nvidia-virtual-gpu-drivers/tesla-m60-vib-drivers-for-esxi-host-/If you have a look and are still unsure about the process, it’s always worth speaking to Dell directly to help offer guidance this first time. Obviously if you have any issues or comments about the process after that, then come back to us on here and we’ll see what we can do.RegardsMGWell this is likely the issue seeing as the person who manages the license servers (me) is different from the person who buys the licenses (my boss).

You would also need to invest in proper remoting stacks like Citrix or VMWare to get the given remoting performance necessary. Even with VDI (which would be a much better approach) you won’t get the baremetal performance.\\nIf you don’t have other arguments like simplfied management or flexibility, I would stick with the laptops.Best regards\\nSimonSimon,Thank you again. I will list some scenarios below and expectations and please tell me if my understanding is correct:Assuming the same A2 video card.In regards to the A2 video card, getting a VAPP license will allow it to be used for CAD Graphics work?VApp license: If I have a Remote Desktop Session host that serves 10 users and of those\\nusers only 2 will be using the CAD program, do I need to get vAPP license for all 10 or can the vApp be activated for specific users and be transferable?Second scenario:  Remote Desktop Session host. Users would need basic 2D acceleration and basic 3D acceleration just for faster screen refreshes and to offload Chrome graphics rendering from the CPU.If I assume 1080p at 16-bit color for each monitor with each user having 4 screens, if I calculate total number of users will that be good starting point for GPU Vram requirements or will I need to reserve or account more GPU VRAM?GPU Paravirtualization. Microsoft has been unclear on support. What is NVIDIA’s stance and requirements on sharing a GPU with say 2 Remote desktop session host servers? What are the requirements and other considerations like MMIO space? Where is the MMIO space of say 32GB come from for some cards and is it reserved by the HOSTS RAM that I have to account for?What NVIDIA licensing considerations come into play with GPU-P?Thank you again,\\nHarryMIn regards to the A2 video card, getting a VAPP license will allow it to be used for CAD Graphics work?\\n-Depends on the CAD requirements. As I said, RDSH is always difficult. But yes, most applications should workVApp license: If I have a Remote Desktop Session host that serves 10 users and of those\\nusers only 2 will be using the CAD program, do I need to get vAPP license for all 10 or can the vApp be activated for specific users and be transferable?\\n-For sure every CCU needs a license. You cannot prevent a user on a RDSH host with GPU to use the GPU therefore should be pretty clear that all users need to be licensedSecond scenario: Remote Desktop Session host. Users would need basic 2D acceleration and basic 3D acceleration just for faster screen refreshes and to offload Chrome graphics rendering from the CPU.\\n-Same license. Really makes no difference.If I assume 1080p at 16-bit color for each monitor with each user having 4 screens, if I calculate total number of users will that be good starting point for GPU Vram requirements or will I need to reserve or account more GPU VRAM?\\n-No, you need ~8GB FB for 15 CCU as a baseline. Depending on the use case (CAD apps) you might end up with way less users on the host.GPU Paravirtualization. Microsoft has been unclear on support.

Once setting the host to \"Shared Direct\" and restarting xorg, all is well.This this exactly the problem I was running into, thanks for sharing the solution.vSphere 6.5 and November 2016 GRID drivers (both Kepler and Maxwell) require changing the default GPU mode from “Shared” (vSGA) to “Shared Direct” (vGPU) via vCenter to enable vGPU support for VMs.Not changing this will result in the VMs with a vGPU profile assigned to not start with the standard “graphics resources not available” error.For those that may be starting to evaluate the November 2016 GRID drivers with vSphere 6.5, an additional step to configure the GPU mode is required.Procedure:This new requirement and procedures will ba added to the documentation shortly, thank you for reporting this issue.I found this and configured my server this way.  It caused all my VMs set to use vmware svga to have issues.  I don’t need them to use the GPU at all.  I only wanted to enable for some.Is this the new way we need to configure?  To have all the VMs use the GPU, regardless of if needed?This happened to VMs that did not have the Shared PCI added with a profile.Hi,Thanks alot for this info. I was working with NVIDIA support team on SR  161202-000639 with no avail until I came with this community.Once again thanks alot Jeremy MainThis worked perfectly and make sure to restart xorg as mentioned by Yem above. I have edited my comments per @Sschaber below.@Taskman: There are different versions of vGPU manager. Our documentation is fully correct. We reference on the Maxwell based vGPU manager (>GRID 2.0) but there is still the kepler one for public download as this version is for K1/K2 only and doesn’t require a GRID license.RegardsSimon@Jmain: I tried to follow your procedure to change the GPU from \"Shared\" to \"Shared Direct\". Although I dont see Edit option available under Graphics setting for my ESxi host. I am running vsphere 6.0.0. Where else can I change the Graphics settings?Hi, this is an option only for vSphere 6.5. You won’t find it on 6.0!!!Hi - Any thoughts on how to fix the ‘GPU memory’ error if we are not on 6.5 vSphere ?  I am on 6.0.0 rev 3018524 of vSphere.  I just upgraded some Esxi hosts to 6.0 Patch 5 ( i.e. rev 5572656 ).  I now can not turn on any VM’s with a K2 card. Do i need to force them to vGPU mode ?  im trying to figure out how to do that now with the rev’s im at .

Any suggestions? Which documentation outlines these steps btw?Ok. I’m getting conflicting info. Should the Tesla M60 GPU card be in PCI passthrough on the ESXi host, or should it not be, in order for vGPU to work? GRID requirements use to state GPU passthrough, but what about Tesla M60? Does the VIB take care of all of that? When I place into passthrough I now notice xorg won’t start and nvidia-smi complains of an initialization error.\\nSo, what’s the correct procedures for ESXi 6.5 with Tesla M60 and Horizon View 7.3 in order to utilize vGPU?For sure you can’t run the GPU in PCI Passthrough if you want to use vGPU.I’m on ESXI 6.5 not using vCenter how do I enable shared-direct graphics? I can’t find the option anywhere.I tried to do it through esxcli but it says I can only set the GPU to Shared, or SharedPassthruPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

I have already done GPU passthrough on a handful of cards without too much hassle. My question is around the GV100 and whether this card will behave just like a regular Quadro.From reading the literature on Nvidia Grid, it seems that the GV100 is not on the required hardware list, however given its expensive nature, I wanted to double check prior to taking the plunge. So here is my question, can GV100 be passed to a Windows VM without any additional special license (I am not looking to share the GPU across other VMs).TIA!HiThe GV100 is the Quadro equivalent of the V100 (Tesla). It supports Passthrough only or you can use it in a typical workstation tower chassis. It does not support vGPU and does not require any licensing.If you wanted a Quadro GPU that also supports vGPU you’d need to use the Actively cooled version of the RTX6000 / RTX8000 or the A6000 (all 3 of those GPUs are Quadro).RegardsMGThanks a bunch, that’s what I thought.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

For example, if vGPU-A uses a kernel that consumes all the available thread blocks of the GPU then vGPU-B have to wait for the vGPU-A to finish?HiThe Framebuffer is dedicated to each VM, but everything else is shared. To help give the best experience / performance there are a few Schedulers that you can select from or modify depending on your use case. You can read about how these work and how to modify them here: https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/latest/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#changing-vgpu-scheduling-policyRegardsMGThanks for the reply,\\nBut my question is does the Nvidia vGPU share the same limitations as the normal scenario?\\nFor example, a kernel cannot preempt the other Kernel that occupies all of the GPU resources.HiIf you’re asking whether a single VM can consume the entire GPU so that other VMs are negatively impacted when they try and access it, then the answer is yes. A GPU is no different to any other virtualised resource.To prevent this from happening as much as possible, the Scheduler can be configured to allocate different amounts of the GPUs resources between multiple VMs in different ways, as per the link above.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

But again we had it running for a long time, with good results.Today I believe we can still run about 3-4 users on a 1A profile. Because we have a few \"test\" Citrix servers that still have the 1A profile active and it’s running fine, but the amount of users never really exceeds 3-4 users.Our \"prime time\" for user logins is about 8:00 in the morning:\\n1A profile, 8-10 users, the issue would appear after 2-4 hours.\\n2A profile, 8-10 users, the issue would appear after maybe 7-24 hours.\\n4A profile, 8-10 users, not sure we have been able to reproduce the issue.\\n8A profile, 8-10 users, not an issue.You would think that it’s an issue with framebuffer overflowing to \"windows paging\", and at some point something goes wrong… We haven’t found a way to monitor this or investigate this further.Trying to revert to the original configuration, is something we have discussed a lot of times. As you say, it’s just out of interest in testing. We have come to the conclusion that it’s not worth it. We would not run that in production anyway. Being able to do vMotion with a GPU attached is an amazing feature.This have for sure changed our perspective on the importance of always running within supported versions. Maybe we would have seen the issue start earlier, if we only changed 1 major component at a time. But what’s most likely, that you run into issues running a supported or a unsupported setup?Just for the record, in my POC testing of last year using the 2012R2 golden image I consistently noticed the behaviour that whenever the total framebuffer memory exceeded 8GB (at that time I used the 8A profile) the virtual machine entered a ‘hung’ state and could only be saved by a full hard reset. People’s active citrix sessions were lost as a result.Now in production using 16a profiles and a brand new 2019 golden image I have never dared so far to allow or force the virtual machine to exceed the 16GB total framebuffer memory. Highest I’ve seen was 95% load.@MrGRIDfor the record, what is the expected behaviour according to your knowledge/experience ? Would the fact that I now assign a complete T4 card with its 16GB mem exclusively (as opposed to a 8a profile) to 1 virtual machine make any difference ?Hi AthomsenSorry for the delay in responding, busy time at the moment …Regarding Supporterd vs Unsupported; Supported should always give less issues as that configuration will have been validated to work together and this is what you would always want in a production environment for that peace of mind. Unfortunately what you’re experiencing at the moment isn’t a matter of support, it’s a physical, technical limitation and the correct way to resolve it is to scale out.If you have any budget available, a more cost effective way to resolve this maintaining support could be to look at using C240 M4s with a couple of M10s installed. M4 architecture is really cheap now because it’s superseded, plus you won’t need any local disks (again helping to reduce cost) so this shouldn’t cost you too much to do and this would give you 8 VMs per C240 (in 2U compared to B200s which if you’re using a UCS 5108 is 6U) meaning that in 6U you could have 24x 8GB GPUs instead of 8. Connect them up to your AFF and it may be a viable solution to see you through until your next platform upgrade, which, if this was installed in 2017, should typically only be about another 1-2 years absolute maximum depending on how you run your technology lifecycle. It depends on whether you’d want to start the next upgrade a little early, or top this one up to keep it going and then upgrade the entire thing in one go with a new technology stack. But adding C240 M4s is definitely a cost effective way to add more density whilst maintaining support at this stage.Hi ProfundidoI’ve not personally had machines crash when they run out of resource, but the performance of the machine is severely impacted to a point where it becomes unusable for anyone connected. I don’t run any of my environments consistently above 85-90% Framebuffer usage. This allows a little headroom when required.Regarding 8GB vs 16GB, the end result when you run out of resource should be the same, and this is purely down to how the environment will be designed and whether you want to scale up or out, the type of Applications being used etc etc. 2x 8GB should give you the same total density as 1x 16GB. However you need to account for additional CPU and RAM for the extra VM, as there are economies of scale for scaling up vs out, not forgetting Windows Licensing costs, Management etc etc …RegardsMGWe will not be buying additional hardware for our current platform. Instead the plan is to look forward and plan for our next platform.At the moment the M10 GPU seems like the best choice for maximum density/cost, but it’s an old GPU. Designing a new platform with the M10 for the next 4-5 year would not be ideal. It’s also the only current GPU on the now \"old\" Maxwell architecture.Is there a replacement on the way? Maybe on the latest ampere architecture?Yes, the only reason I listed the M10 was to maintain your existing (Cisco) M4 architecture throughout so you could extend the capacity with the same ecosystem without upgrading. Pascal and newer GPUs require M5+ architecture. You certainly wouldn’t design anything new with Maxwell today (Maxwell has been superseded 4 times!), and this is something I routinely mention on here.The nearest replacement for the M10 is the T4. For configuration information on that, start from the beginning of this topic as we discuss it in detail. We’ll have to see if anything gets announced at GTC in a few weeks regarding any replacements. But even before looking at that, it’s worth asking Cisco if or when their M6 architecture is going to arrive so you can make sure you have the latest tech from all vendors.RegardsMGWe will not be buying additional hardware for our current platform.

That’s what you should design around imho and the best platform to support it up till today is the one I’m having in production right now.It’s just a matter of time now for that Ampere-based T4 successor.

Updates in Release 11.1\\nNew Features in Release 11.1\\nSupport for Multi-Instance GPU (MIG)-backed vGPUs on GPUs that support MIG\\nSupport for GPUDirect® technology remote direct memory access (RDMA)\\nSecurity updates - see Security Bulletin: NVIDIA GPU Display Driver - September 2020\\nMiscellaneous bug fixes\\nHardware and Software Support Introduced in Release 11.1\\nSupport for the following GPUs:\\nNVIDIA A100 PCIe 40GB\\nNVIDIA A100 HGX 40GBValidated releases for GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture:\\nSince 11.1: NVIDIA A100 PCIe 40GB\\nSince 11.1: NVIDIA A100 HGX 40GBIt looks like the A40(=RTX a6000?) is going through its validation cycle for Grid and will apppear in 11.2 or shortly after. Well at least we’re getting there…By the way, something else: Considering this new info and the design I ended up choosing with those specific servers and risers which currently hold 4 T4 cards per physical host server I realized it is now confirmed to be the best most versatile full futureproof set up possible because:The only thing that might still limit that a little bit further is the dual cpu PCIE lanes limitation in terms of max lanes per riser but even then it still will allow for the most possible vGPU to be configured per physical server.So that’s a relief for me. Now I can rest in peace realizing we didn’t buy anything ‘wrong’ for the next upcoming generation. On the contrary ;)update: I’ve been following up when the A40 would actually start making its appearance in the new software releases and documentation, checking it every week. Today is the first time I see the all new 12.0 software and the A40 hardware being mentioned and supported in it:https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/12.0/whats-new-vgpu/index.htmlThat sure took its sweet time ;)Hi there, thank you for this topic. It’es really helpful to size correctly a CVAD Session Host farm. I have a few question still :Since Citrix by default does not use video codec for whole screen but only for Actively changing regions, as long as we do not choose to use video codec for the entire screen, GPU will not be used and frambuffer will not be impacted ? How does it work if not ?Is the A40 the new recommended best way to go for user density in a Session Host environnment ?For 20-30 users, what profile should be used ? Is A40-8A still recommended or should we go with 16 ? We have a 2019 farm with users doing mainly office work but sometimes uses video (yxoutube etc,…) as well as video conferencing. Video conf and youtube can be offloaded to client with content redirection and so usually it’s not an issue.Hi Karsayor,-According to my experience every citrix session from its build up immediately and continuously consumes framebuffer memory from start till end of the session, regardless of “actively changing regions” policy choice or different. Only vGPU computing power is affected by this and will only spike when triggered. This can be monitored nicely using RD analyzer and GPU profiler.-the A40 in combination with HP DL380 latest gen would be my absolute top choice since it will allow you to scale out better than the T4’s and any other solution out there in the world. Framebuffer memory is the (known) bottleneck here and the A40 is the perfect solution. (provided they work just as well as the T4’s and don’t have child diseases)-I’ve personally tested that a 16GB profile supports up to or almost 20 users so I designed that for 15 users. If I would have to make a new design from scratch today for newest tech (full 2019 server graphical interface) that would be still it: 16GB per 15-20 users depending on load profile and take it from there. When I started my testings I was able to cram alot more users in because I was testing on my 2012R2 farm. When going live in production with my new farm based on 2019 server I realized that framebuffer memory usage had DOUBLED pretty much. That’s why my initial scaling only used something like 8GB profiles per 20 users.I hope this answers all your questionsThank you ! I have two more.\\nimage836×675 14.2 KB\\nI’m not sure if Citrix Director alone is sufficient. I’ve always used GPU profiler since it’s realtime so my analysis is based off of that.Yes, 2019 is a 7year jump ahead into the future compared to 2012. The 2019 OS as a front end user experience has changed dramatically and become alot more graphically intensive. I invite you to test it as well and see it with your own eyes.Hi guys,About licensing the vGPU, if I have 2x XenApp vms running on VMware where each vm will receive a T4-8A profile and each vm should receive about 10 users, what is the right way to license it?Should be 2 vApps licenses considering that I have 2 vms or 20 vApps licenses considering that is the number of concurrent users logged on XenApp.Best\\nFabricioFabricio,I’m not an official VMware representative nor affiliated (so feel free to double-check with one) but as far as I have understood the Vmware licensing model it’s the number of the concurrent users when used in Citrix Xenapp (aka Virtual apps) where multiple users share 1 vGPU while the per-machine device model applies to scenario’s such as e.g Xendesktop where each content creator uses his own dedicated machine and thus has its own dedicated vGPU.How come you eneded up doubling the profile at 16Gb since MrGrid said that 8Gb should be enough to 20-25 ? There is that much of a difference between 2012 R2 and 2019 ?To answer your question, yes, there’s a huge difference between 2012 and 2019, it’s a huge jump, but there’s more to it than that. The Application requirements and how Users work have also moved on as well. Users running higher multiples of tabs in browsers, more applications open at the same time, newer versions of things like MS Office etc etc all contributes to increased resource usage.You can’t build a hardware spec based on a software stack that’s 2 generations old, update to current versions of that software and expect the same density, which is why you need to allow headroom in your hardware Spec for newer software, or plan to run certain versions of software throughout the lifecycle of the environment before the next refresh.If monitoring for GPU utilisation (framebuffer in your case), the best place to monitor is using nvidia-smi, as this is directly on the GPU. This will give you the most accurate results. Don’t forget, framebuffer is only one component you should be monitoring, there are lots of others to consider as well.Regarding licensing, vGPU is per concurrent user, whether it’s RDSH or VDI. Each user “that is connected” needs a vGPU license. If you have 20 users, but only 10 are connected at a time, then you need 10 licenses. If all 20 are connected at the same time, you need 20 licenses. The only exception to this is vCS, where the software is licensed per GPU, not per user.RegardsMGOk, very good thank you !Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

But I am a bit overwhelmed and unfamiliar regarding Host OS options, hypervisors, Nvidia vGPU licensing…\\nThe server they want is the Asus ESC8000 G4 https://www.asus.com/us/Commercial-Servers-Workstations/ESC8000-G4/ this is bare meta and it (currently) does not support esxi which we use for our other servers.\\nThe goal for me most likely being responsible for setup and implementation is OS familiarity, minimal headache and learning curve and to keep prices down.\\nThanks for bearing with my long post.HiFor simplicity, support, stability, management, compatibility, scaling, general information and all the other benefits associated with enterprise grade hardware, you should be looking at something from one of the big OEMs (Dell, HP, Cisco etc) as your core enterprise infrastructure where you’re supporting hundreds / thousands of concurrent students workloads 24x7x365.As you work in EDU, you should be entitled to significant EDU specific discounts from the OEMs (including NVIDIA) which should make life easier and save you going for less appropriate brands. If you purchase your hardware and NVIDIA licenses from the same vendor (Dell for example) you can negotiate much better discounts.AI isn’t just about the GPU, the whole platform needs to be an end-to-end solution or you will have performance bottlenecks. Storage and network are also crucial to avoiding these issues. You should be looking at nothing less than All Flash / NVMe storage for your workloads and 10GB+ networking depending on where you run the workloads from.As for GPUs, you’ll be wanting V100 and / or T4 GPUs. As you’re working with AI, you’ll want QvDWS licensing which is licensed per concurrent user (so every concurrent (not named) user will need a QvDWS license).Depending on your requirements, you may want a single extremely high powered server (DGX-1 for example, which has 8x V100s running in NVLink and some very special software)) and then a more granular set of servers to cater for student density (maybe a Hyperconverged infrastructure that combines high performance Storage and Compute with linear scaling and easy management, something like Cisco Hyperflex for example combined with multiple T4s per Node). Or if you want individual Nodes, then a Dell R740 / HP DL380 / Cisco C240 all with multiple T4s attached to a high performance All Flash storage appliance would suffice.If a DGX-1 is a slightly scary proposition due to its software stack, then you could go for something like the \"EMC DSS8440\" from Dell which supports up to 10x V100s where you could simply drop ESXi on to it and then virtualise each of the V100s to provide multi user support per GPU. With the latest NVIDIA vGPU software, Multi-vGPU support is available so you could connect multiple V100s into a single VM for added performance if required. Local storage available on this server is both SSD and NVMe and the CPU options currently are dual Xeon Platinum 8168 2.7G, 24C/48T. The slight caveat here is that (unlike the DGX-1) this server is PCIe and doesn’t support NVLink and it also doesn’t support more than 1TB of RAM currently. Cascade Lake Scalable Xeons should be coming for it towards the end of this year / early next year, when hopefully Dell will allow more RAM to be added as well. However, it’s a great bit of kit to get you started if you wanted to go down that route, and then for greater user density scale out to other infrastructure (as mentioned above) using T4s.With respect (and having personally seen it a few times from customers) … You say you want to keep costs down (just like everyone else) but if you cheap out on the platform to start with, it’ll cost you more in the long term by delivering poor performance, limited component support, functionality and scalability (you’ve already mentioned that ASUS doesn’t support ESXi) and most importantly a bad user experience.Speak to the OEMs first, see what EDU discounts are available to you (you should be entitled to some) and go from there.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

There is no problem if the RTX A6000 is not damaged in terms of hardware, but is there a possibility that damage will occur in terms of hardware?The concept of vGPU always works only with VMs. If you want to use GPU partitions on baremetal then you can only use MIG with A30 or A100 GPUs.

So I decided to change / modify the BIOS. I made a backup of the original BIOS (unfortunately just one, as I was not aware that this might be of importance…) and flashed the cards using one original BIOS of card B, leading the system to hang, both Linux (CentOS 7) and Win10 (I think at the very moment when the drivers are loaded, as Win10 wihout installed K80 drivers boots fine). Same behavior when I used the “pairs” of BIOSs from Card B to flash Cards A, A’ (and I cannot remember for sure, but I think at this time, Card A’ had also two different Board IDs…)\\nSo I used “Kepler BIOS Tweaker” from techpowerup to modify the original BIOS I got from Card A, and flashed it to all GPUs of Card B, B’ (using the nvflash for win with the Board ID test disabled…), which particulary led to a success, as the first GPU of the Cards A, A’ ran at 875MHz, but the second one at lower clocks (mostly at 562MHz, sometimes a bit more, but never fullspeed).\\nAs I was not able to find original, unmodofied VBIOSs for the K80, I decided to go for a firmware package of HP (containing the BIOSs versions 80.21.1F.00.06 and 80.21.1F.00.05). This was a *scexe and ran without any issues. However, similar behaviour as before, but the second GPU runs at even lower clocks…\\nAfter googeling (there is not much to find about the K80s), I found (by chance) ONE entry at the HP support describing the possibility to recover the original BIOS (which had the card at the time of shipping). So I guess there is a ROM on the card, which can be copied to the EPROM? This is a feature each electronic device using any kind of firmware should have…However, the tool is named iromflsh_ext and is stated to recover the “Info ROM” (is this the same as the BIOS? If yes, why different names? If no, what is this?), runs under linux and performed without any error, stating success. However, The BIOS Versions stayed the same, which I cannot believe to be true.So, thank you for reading so far, I know a lot of text (but a lot of info, too).What I would would like to know now:How can you help me?Experts, freaks, tweakers and modders, any help would be highly appreciated, if you need some more infos on the hardware, please let me know what is of interest.Thanks a lot for your precious time,Grettings from Vienna,ErnstPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

We are trying to do something similar and would you to ask some questions about this.\\nWe have a Grid K1 server here and trying to realize this solution on a native headless Linux Server without a hypervisor solution like XenServer etc.So the first thing I want to ask is, how do you handling latency with the Rift? In VR Application, latency is more important than in usual Application, so in best case, you would have 30ms latency for the Server, 30ms for the networking and 16 on client side, without the Software Overhead for getting Position from the Rift Device to the Server.I know the video from Jason Southern is not quite long, but I am interested in if he uses a shim layer Application for Encoding, or does he instrumentalizes the Oculus Application to get informations needed?\\nWe want to try some Optimizations for Frameprediction so where would you cut the Application to realize something like that?Best regardsHow to register in Ukraine?I saw a video on Youtube, where Jason Southern has connected an Oculus Rift with a Grid Server. We are trying to do something similar and would you to ask some questions about this.I didn’t build it, the Occulus setup was actually by Magnar Johnsen, and nothing was done to minimise latency beyond optimising hte network.Magnar has a blog here:https://www.virtualexperience.no/Latency is a huge issue with VR, and there’s a lot of research going into how to enhance the experience using remote protocols.Maybe this video by Magnar. https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2014/05/23/is-running-xendesktop-remotely-on-a-server-8000km-away-with-700ms-latency-on-an-airplane-with-an-oculus-rift-virtual-reality-application-insane/This was done on the oculus v1, later versions have been problematic to get working as oculus changed some stuff that made it less citrix/VMware friendly. In v1, support just happened by multi-monitor support.Latency per se isn’t an issue depending on what you are doing - in this case with magnar on 700ms was fine because he was essentially watching video, a rollarcoaster simulation. Video is very tolerant, can be buffered. Interactive shoot-em-up or CAD will be harder as you can’t fight the speed of light (although Citrix’s new USB on WAN - see Wacom support has some support that could be exploited in these scenarios to some extent)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Some non-persistent VDI clients are already deleted but are still registered in the NVIDIA license manager because the lease time is not expired. Is there a way to shorten the lease time or delete the client from the NVIDIA license manager?Sure, just reduce the lease time in License server Web UI.\\nThe default is 7 days so reduce it to 1 day as example.RegardsSimonWhere is that option in the UI and what version of the license manager are you using?Hi,sorry, my mistake. This is done with the RegKey:Documentation for system administrators that describes NVIDIA Virtual GPU licensed products and how to configure licensing for them on supported hardware.See LicenseInterval…RegardsSimonI believe there was a ‘Drop Client’ option on the older licence server however i don’t see this option on the latest GRID5 license server.  REGKEY looks to be the only option for client removalHi Nealus,you’re right. Unfortunately this option was removed from Flexera. We’re working on this to get the option back or another improvement.RegardsSimonWe have Tesla M10s and are running the 5.0 management console and cannot remove licenses that were assigned to deleted VMs. We also do not have those registry entries mentioned since our licenses do not have an expiration date but are perpetual instead. What makes it worse is that Nvidia support never calls back after the case is opened. Is there a workaround to this issue for customers that have perpetual (permanent) licensing?Hi Streuber,the workaround was posted 3 posts above. Please implement the RegKey.RegardsSimonDo I have to set LicenseInterval REGKEYS on Vm or on License Server or both?Just on the connecting client.I don’t fully understand how i can remove licensed clients if this VMs are deleted?\\nAbout LicenseInterval REGKEYS i understand, i can do it, when i still have VMs, but when they are delete, only option is to wait default LicenseInterval what is 7 days?Correct, there is currently no way to delete individual licensed clients.I am studying how NVIDIA Licensing works and will setup a Failover License Server. As we all agree,there is currently no way to delete individual licensed clients.But what, if it is too late, and like Edgars I have to free this locked licenses?Can I just wait for, let’s say 1 day, or are they never release again?Do I have to delete the license server database and set it up again, to get back my locked licenses?Locked licenses will be relased (default) after 24h.How is this done on a Linux based License server?Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

The A16 card(s) are listed properly in the device manager and are accessible in GPU-Z.What are we missing?Upon further reading, the documentation states:In a bare-metal deployment, you can use NVIDIA vGPU software graphics drivers with vWS and vApps licenses to deliver remote virtual desktops and applications. If you intend to use Tesla boards without a hypervisor for this purpose, use NVIDIA vGPU software graphics drivers, not other NVIDIA drivers.However, I do not see a standalone vGPU driver in the SOFTWARE DOWNLOADS section.  I attempted to use the Hyper-V “Complete DDA GPU driver package for Microsoft platforms”, but the 64-bit Windows 2019 server driver reports that it doesn’t detect any cards.Is there a different driver that I should be installing?Hi,You did the right thing. Guest driver is the same in all the packages. This driver should definetely recognize A16 GPU\\nCoul you elaborate which driver you tried?\\nI would recommend to use LTSB release 13.8.In the nvidia Licensing Portal, I selected Software Downloads which presents ~115 pages of packages.I chose the latest Microsoft Hyper-V:Microsoft Hyper-V Server\\n11.13\\nComplete DDA GPU driver package for Microsoft platforms\\nJun 26, 2023That package contains the driver installer:454.23_grid_win10_server2016_server2019_64bit_international.exeWhen I run that package, it reports no card found.  I don’t see a standalone vGPU driver package after scrolling through the entire collection of packages.  I don’t recall seeing any packages marked with ‘LTSB’.vGPU 11.x cannot work!\\nPlease use the current vGPU 13.8 package as stated above.\\nBTW: a current release date doesn’t mean it is the newesg version but this branch got a minor update if it is also a LTSB brach which we support for at least 3 years.Please see NVIDIA Virtual GPU (vGPU) Software Documentatio to get more infos on our release cadence…Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",
       " 'tesla-p4-in-plex-server': 'I have a home-lab and, within that, I use a Win10 VM on Windows Server 2019 (HyperV) as my dedicated Plex server.  It’s all running on a Dell R730xd machine. I’m planning on passing through a Tesla P4 GPU that I managed to pick up recently and I’m curious what vGPU license is needed for Plex transcoding. Would I need an RTX vWorkstation license or could I get away with vApp or vPC?  I currently have a vWorkstation license dedicated to a Tesla P40 on another machine (HP DL380 G9) and it would be good if I could get the P4 running on something more cost effective for this use case. Thanks!After pulling the trigger on the Tesla P4 and passing it through to my Windows 10 VM Plex Server (and doing a bit of tinkering), it turns out the Plex transcoder is able to use the P4 to transcode video streams using nothing more than the free data center drivers that can be downloaded from the Nvidia main site.  Performance of the P4 in this use case is excellent.  Very happy with the outcome and it was nice to discover that I could get this working without subscribing to another vGPU license… just thought I’d share for others.Hi Roland.\\nI recently got a P4 and I am trying to get a Dell PE 720 setup as my new plex server. I am having issues with transcoding 4K. Do you have any insight?ThanksPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

What components are needed to install this?We have both processors, a PCI riser card, but it looks like it still needs a power cable?What am I missing? Did I get the wrong riser cage? I’m ordering a bigger Power supply, so that isn’t the issue.Pictured below is a closeup on the aux power adapter. http://i.imgur.com/aphvj1d.jpgYou require the PCIe power cable.When you purchased the K1 card from HP did they advise on the GPU enablement requirements? They may provide all the components as a single kit (several OEM’s do).Did you ever get this working I have the same issue ?it ended up we needed an additional power cable, and patches that weren’t on the main website.

       " 'duplicate-features-when-uploading-licenses': 'I’m trying to upload our license.bin file to a License server that was recently deployed.  We have two vAPP licenses (features(?)), for 5 users each.  However if i try to upload a .bin with both of them (for a total of 10 users), i get the error:[\"key\" : \"Capability response rejected: the response has features with duplicate feature ID: <some kind of key?>\", \"message\" : \"Capability response rejected: the response has features with duplicate feature ID: <same key(?)>\"]This worked originally, and the server showed 4 features in the \"Licensed Feature Usage\" page;Quadro-Virtual-DWS , Count 5\\nGRID-Virtual-Apps, Count 5\\nGRID-Virtual-Apps, Count 5\\nGRID-Virtual-PC, Count 5We had an issue with the default lease times, so cleared the \"nvidia\" folder to drop all leases, then when going to reapply the .bin, got the above message.  However, it works if we remove the second V-App feature @ ui.licensing.nvidia.com and download the license file that way.How can we get the server to accept the .bin with both Virtual-Apps in it?HiTry resetting the License Server, then download a new license file from the License Portal to replace your existing one. I’m not sure why the current license shows duplicate features, did they come from a different PAK? Make sure the new license contains your total user count and feature requirements.RegardsMGFor such issues please open a support ticket with NVES and let them look into it.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'horizon-windows-10-evc-and-gpus-adding-newer-generation-of-processors-and-gpus': 'Hello,  Just wondering if there is any guidance on preventing problems with adding new host with newer generation of GPU, RAM and processors to a existing cluster?    Do you loose vmotion capabilities?HiDifferent CPUs are fine as you can use EVC, however you may lose features and functionality of the new CPUs until other Servers are upgraded / replaced with the same CPUs. RAM doesn’t make any difference.Different GPUs can exist in the same Cluster, however you can’t vMotion between different GPUs. So you can’t vMotion from a T4 to a RTX 6000 for example.Best way to handle that, is either start a new Cluster with the newer Server hardware and gradually build that out, that way you maintain the full feature set of all components and can vMotion between Servers. Or, you can gradually replace the Servers in your existing Cluster, however until all Servers are the same specs, you won’t be able to use all the features and functionality.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

I was wondering if someone could give me some hints on how to solve a problem with the NVIDIA driver installer I’m having when connecting an RTX 4090 to a VM trough DDA. Here is the scenario:I followed the steps described by Microsoft here in order to connect the GPU to my virtual machine.It could be relevant that, when profiling the PC to check if the GPU would accept DDA, it first showed me that the device was using line-based interruptions. I followed this information to change it to message signaled-based interrupts.The problem comes when I try to install the driver on the virtual machine. The device is detected before installing it, but, when the setup ends (failing), the device manager shows the GPU as disconnected (Error 45).Before installing the driver.\\n\\nimage1369×875 214 KB\\nAfter installing the driver.\\n\\nimage1367×875 230 KB\\nDriver installer error.\\n\\nimage1366×879 62.4 KB\\nThanks!You need to increase MIMO to 33Gb with:Set-VM -HighMemoryMappedIoSpace 33GB -VMName $vm,and reboot vm.

However, it is only supported by several GPUs. The GPU supporting MIG should have Ampere architecture and its compute capability version should be at least 8.0. My GPU has Ampere’s architecture but I couldn’t find any information about its compute capability. The RTX A5000 GPU has an 8.6 version so I supposed my GPU also has at least that version.

So I would have to change the CPU or the Graphics card.Is it true? Can you send to me a proof link?HiI’m not familiar with current HPE power limitations, but that doesn’t sound right at all. And for HPE’s sake, I hope the Sales Manager is mistaken. I would suggest you speak to someone else at HPE about this.Depending on your urgency, if HPE can’t currently do it, Dell can 100% support that configuration (No, I don’t work for Dell). I’m in the process of deploying dual AMD EPYC with a 240W TDP and 3x RTX 8000, so I can validate it’s definitely possible.Speak to a different HPE Sales Manager or maybe someone technical in Pre-Sales from HPE would be better.

It has lots of configuration options, including the one you specifically mention above (and the on-line configurator is far easier to use then HPE’s ;-) ).Other than HPE and Dell, there’s IBM, Cisco and Supermicro, then you’re in to lesser known brands.I don’t use IBM or Supermicro so can’t comment on them. Cisco don’t currently list the RTX GPUs against their Servers, as Cisco only support Passive GPUs and the Passive RTX versions have only recently been released. They will support them, but I’m not sure when that will be official. If you want it today, then Dell would be my recommendation.The Dell PowerEdge R7525 rack server delivers powerful performance and flexible configurations. The bedrock of the modern data center.As with all the Server OEMs, you can safely ignore the on-line price. Once configured, get it priced properly through your distributor.RegardsMGThanks MrGRID,I like Supermicro, but I can’t find a platform which support Epyc and GPU together :(HiGo with Dell.

       " 'remote-desktop-session-host-gpu-load-balancing': 'Hi,Just wondering if anyone is successfully using multiple GPUs on a Server 2019 Remote Desktop Session Host?I’m in the process of testing a couple of new session hosts, I’m running them bare metal with Quadro P2200 GPUs (the session hosts aren’t expected to do any heavy stuff, just web browsing and documents - this is for a school so cost is a big factor).Server 2019 is supposed to perform ‘Load balancing between multiple GPUs presented to the OS’ according to this:Provides information about supported configurations for RDS in Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019.So I’ve tried sticking both GPUs in one box to establish if this increases our user capacity relative to single GPU performance, and in the testing I’m getting some strange results.Basically the test is that I log onto the session host and open internet explorer with a web page with a lot of active content (background video, spinny graphics…) which happens to be the school website, then repeat for as many sessions as it takes to saturate the CPU.With no GPU installed, this happens at 4 users - with the single Quadro P2200 we get up to 11 users.When running two Quadro P2200’s in the host, we get to nearly 20 users before the CPU is saturated, but you can see that the website is not rendering smoothly - there are stops and starts.The issues become obvious looking at task manger - GPU 0 is running at:\\n95% 3d load\\n0% video encode\\n11% copy\\n52% video decodewhere GPU 1 is running at:\\n14% 3d load\\n57% video encode\\n29% copy\\n2% video decodeSo obviously the load being created is not being properly shared between the two.Is there some way to make this work?I could virtualize two session hosts on each physical host and pass through one quadro to each vm to workaround the problem, but the hope was to keep the setup required on each host as simple as possible.Just to be clear we are using the vanilla RDP protocol for this, with AVC444 etc enabled via Group Policy.Heho,have you any update to your problem, reached any conclusions?Does nvidiaopenglrdp do anything to alleviate the choppy RDP experience?\\nDid you try to lift the 30fps RDP limit up 60fps?\\nDoes AVC 4:2:2 instead of 4:4:4 anything in this regard?\\nHave you some idea how the picture changes between a bare metal deployment and a virtualized one, with DDA?\\nDid you try a consumer card like a 12GB RTX3060 in conjunction with the Quadro?\\nHow bad is the 5GB memory limitation of the P2200 in a multi-Session RDSH enviroment?Questions, questions, questions…Greetings from Berlin.Hi McKay, thanks for getting in touch.To be absolutely clear, the experience is good and smooth when not deliberately overloaded (as I had done in the test).I didn’t try nvidiaopenglrdp as I can’t say I was aware of it at the time, although I wouldn’t imagine any of the elements in the test were opengl, I suppose they could be.I was able to up the RDP framerate on my windows 10 desktop to 60 fps using a registry tweak, i seem to recall recreating the tweak on a session server but finding it wasn’t effective - however I have a feeling that I was running Server 2016 at the time, where there might have been more luck with Server 2019. Ultimately it wasn’t a huge consideration as I doubted our users would notice.I’m sure that AVC 422 would have some effect on the GPU capacity but I didn’t test for it - ultimately this mode looks worse so I was keen to avoid it (I did do some testing with linux based thin clients but results were unsatisfactory, mainly as they had to use CPU decoding).We were using a virtualised session host before commissioning these dedicated physical servers, and it had a Quadro P2200 assigned via DDA on hyper-v - basically our testing showed that CPU limits could be fairly quickly reached on this session host, and we didn’t want to have this contesting with our other server roles that were on the same hypervisor.The easiest and cheapest way for us to scale up was to build a couple of workstations with 3950x CPUs, 64gb ECC RAM and quadro P2200 gpus - our thinking was that this role did not warrant the same level of hardware as a hypervisor that might host core services such as domain controller or email server.These have proved more than ample for our current thin client roll out (22 units), indeed in practice one session host of this spec is plenty if we want to take the other unit offline for maintenance and upgrades.But yes, once we had concluded that the bottleneck most easily hit by the host was CPU usage it made sense to scale up with dedicated physical resources - this calculation will change for you depending on how many users will be on the session hosts and how much CPU availability you have on your hypervisors.I did try a consumer card, but it was only a 4gb GTX 1650 - and it was better in terms of bang for buck, in the same test above I could have 9 clients on the website with Internet Explorer, versus 4 with no GPU, and 11 with the P2200.It made sense at the time to stick with the P2200 as it left open the possibility of virtualising the session host(s) (although happily Nvidia have relaxed their previous restrictions and I am now using that 1650 with DDA in a virtualised desktop role) along with peace of mind that it was professional grade kit.Which GPU makes sense for you will of course depend on what 3d work your users are doing - the actual 3d graphics needs of my users are minimal, hence the basic GPU chosen. You will need to choose your own tests if you want to establish your needs.For our needs, 5gb of memory simply isn’t a limit, although we’re only usually talking about ten users at a time - usually when I check the GPU usage at this time the stats show perhaps 20% memory usage at most.I do think the comparison between the 1650 and p2200 is somewhat interesting as in principle these are very similar graphics cards - the differences being 1gb of RAM and the limit to 2 video encoding streams on the 1650 - it isn’t clear which of the two made the difference so I would be cautious of assuming that a RTX 3060 will be capable of accommodating hugely more users, when it could be the limit hit in that case is the video encoding streams.Certainly it would be capable of accommodating hugely more 3d processing from those users but it wouldn’t necessarily mean you could, for example, achieve 20 or 30 internet explorer users on my test.Anyway, I might have some more time for testing now that we are coming into the summer holidays at last!Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",
       " 'vmotion-behaviour': 'Hi there,Hopefully a quick one for you all…With a standard vSphere GRID deployment, where two ESXi hosts are identical, including GPU, and vMotion functions as expected, can anyone provide details of whether any ‘pre-flight’ checks are done on the GPU side prior to the migration task?Imagine the scenario above, however all the GRID VMs on one host are assigned, say T4-2Q.  On the target host, a VM is running T4-4Q.  Will the migration task stop the migration because the profiles do not match or will the migration take place, and the error only occurs when that VM attempts to boot with the non-matching profile?Thanks in advance - I would run this up myself but our test environment is down for a few days!NealHiIf the 4Q VM you’re migrating is powered on, the migration will fail due to insufficient resources. If the 4Q VM is powered off, then the migration will succeed, but it won’t be able to power on until a GPU with suitable Profile support is available.The issue becomes more interesting in environments that rely on DRS, as DRS is not GPU aware at this time.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Or is it a new deployment that’s only 5 days old?Are these issues there all the time or only on a specific workload? Also, what kind of workload?Have you monitored the GPU locally inside the OS to see how much resource is being used when the issue occurs?RegardsMGHi MG,This is a brand new install on vendor Certified equipment, we ran into this problem when we spinning up some initial Horizon desktops, some of the desktops became unresponsive, the workload is just rendering the desktop using a vGPU, I have watched the output of nvidi-smi vgpu -u while this happens, nothing unusual about the data, from within the VM the desktop is very sluggish like its drops alot of frames, Low utilization of all other resources, and only a single VM on the host.At one time… I was able to get a VM running without errors in the vmware.log and without frame rate issues, this was straight after converting the VM to EFI boot, but I was not able to repeat, it seemed to be a fluke, restarting the same box for another run ended up with the same errors this was on the same host.The errors are indicative of memory remapping issues from the GPU to the Virtual Machine., today I will be looking at the vmkernel.log and mapping out where all the devices are registered on the host and from within the virtual machine focusing on the vGPU.HiI know you’ve mentioned it’s ok, but double check the license is being applied from your license server. Low FPS / sluggish performance is indicative of a license not being applied.You mention the workload is just rendering the desktop, do you mean you’re not running any Apps and the VM is just slow whilst using the OS? If yes, again, sounds initially like a license issue.If the licensing is working and being applied correctly …Have you monitored the vGPU from inside the VM to see what it’s doing? Is it running out of Framebuffer? (How much is it using?)Once the VM has been created, you should not be changing the BIOS mode as they work in different ways and can cause issues. EFI is what you should be using and with the VMware Windows 10 template it’s default and there’s no need to change it.Try a manual clean build Windows 10 VM from scratch. Leave the VM template options, just give it enough vCPUs, RAM, Storage, VMXNET3 Network Adapter and add a vGPU. Install VMTools making sure to do a Custom Install and unselect the vSGA graphics driver so it’s not installed. Get it domain joined and enable RDP, then get the vGPU driver installed. After that, install the Horizon Agent, but without Instant Clone or Linked Clone options. Once installed, install the Direct Connect Agent. Connect directly to the VM and see if the issue still remains.RegardsMGHey Squishy,I encountered a similar issue where I had to use esxcli to kill the frozen GPU enabled VM on 6.7 U3 with the T4 Tesla GPU.One thing i’d check is that your Nvidia ECC settings are set the same across all of your hosts. We had all our hosts set to disable Nvidia ECC except for one. That caused issues when a VM migrated there, where a different host would have a lock on the vmx, which then caused issues with managing the VM in vCenter.I noted also a migration related ECC mismatch error in the vmware.log of the VM.I’m still waiting back to see if those VMs that were impacted will crash again. I am not entirely sure this ECC related migration issue was the cause.Just wanted to follow up, even after verifying all the proper settings, the VMs are still crashing. It’s suspected to relate to a in house developed 3D application that this particular department uses. However, there’s nothing really obvious in the logs other than the overlap entries in the OP. Case opened with Nvidia Enterprise Support for further troubleshooting. Will report back if a solution is found.@squishy,I am curious how that XL190R can accommodate two double width V100 GPUs assuming your configuration has the 32GB V100s, of course.  From the spec sheets I look at, there is only room for one double width GPU card in these based on the backplane slots.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'cloud-virtual-desktop-w-gpu': \"Hello guys,I am prolly the newest kid on the block to be playing or messing around with server grade hardwares but recently I have been searching high and low for the perfect solution to my gaming and my company’s work needs. Most of my staff comes and go and we are a small startup and we usually encourage BYOD - bring your own device. However, most of their devices are low spec devices and I’m toying with the idea of using parsec for them to stream to a virtual powerful desktop instead.Most cloud virtual desktop and gaming solutions are either too expensive or too far from where I am - Asia. ( Input lag ) - i.e GCS, Shadow, MaxSettings, AzureI am now toying with idea of building my own cloud server so 3-5 people could connect to the server via Parsec and use.Unraid is of course the choice of OS for the GPU passthru, However, instead of following Linus 's PC build that have multiple gpu, I was thinking of using Tesla because A) I don’t need any display port output because it’s all virtualized and B) it’s easier to just install one card.However, I would like to knowcan Tesla cards like P4, T4 be used for gaming and rendering and is it as easy as passing the card to the VM on unraid and allocate a certain amount of vgpu ram to each vm ? And can Unraid support vgpu or i do need to have vsphere?same question as above for Quadro p4000/p5000also I couldn’t find any build or tutorials for my setup anywhere. Can someone point me into the right direction? I’m thinking of using Epyc or Xeon or Threadripper 16-32 core processor for this.Thanks in advance.I’ve been thinking of doing something similar for a while, I’m also on unraid. I’ve got a lot of docker containers running and 2 vms, with pass through.

The only exception to this are the RTX6000 / RTX 8000 / A6000 which can use vGPU and standard Quadro drivers.Due to the age of the K1 and K2, these do not require any licensing. However, you’ll be extremely limited on supported driver and Operating System combinations due to their age.RegardsMGThanks for you answer!See, we also already have ability to get \"HP Nvidia J0X20A GRID M40 16GB QUAD GPU\". HPE P/N 796120-001\\nDoes it require Additional Nvidia VGPU lisence in Microsoft DDA GPU pass-through mode (4 VM)\\nWE would like to have 4 VM to work with CAD SoftwareThanks for reply!HiThe M40 is a 1st Generation Maxwell board and is not supported for vGPU.The oldest GPU you should be working with for vGPU would be an M10 which has 4x 8GB GPUs on it and is currently a fully supported board with the latest vGPU Software. This will run CAD workloads (assuming that the other components of the Server are up to Spec), however it should be noted that this is a low performance GPU, but it should allow you to run the software to some degree.I would strongly recommend that you stay well away from anything older than the Maxwell architecture. This means avoiding any GPU starting with a \"K\" (Kepler).Depending on the CAD applications you will be using (AutoCAD ?), you will also benefit from a QvDWS license to get the best performance out of it. This will allow the maximum amount of Framebuffer to be used for each User.That said, although the M10 will run CAD workloads, it is not the ideal board for them. You would typically be looking at something like a T4 in combination with QvDWS, assuming the Generation of DL380 is compatible with the T4 GPU.You’ve mentioned Passthrough / DDA a few times. I’m assuming this is because you are running Hyper-V which currently does not support GPU Virtualisation. The best way forwards would be to either use an M10 with each of the GPUs in Passthrough, and then licensed accordingly, or change your Hypervisor for one that supports GPU Virtualisation. vSphere / XenServer / AHV / KVM all support GPU Virtualisation. That way, you can use a much wider selection of GPUs, and if you’re trying to save costs, you could buy 1x GPU and use the vGPU Software to share it between all of your Users.As a reference, for CAD, you should be looking at the following VM Spec for each User:vCPUs: 4-6 Cores @ 3.0Ghz (3.0Ghz at least - Faster is better)\\nSystem RAM: 12GB (or higher)\\nvGPU: 4GB & QvDWS License (4GB at least or higher depending on model size)\\nStorage: SSD / NVMeRegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'power-off-or-reboot-ubuntu-vm-with-gpu-passthru-disables-gpu': 'Hello I seem to have run into a fun issue.  I am attempting to setup a ubuntu VM with a Quadro P4000 and I’ve run into an issue once drivers load in the VM.  From what I can tell this doesn’t matter if the Guest OS is Server or Desktop.  Here are the details of my environmentHost: Windows Server 2016 Core\\nGPU: Quadro P4000\\nGuest: Ubuntu 20.04I have an app that can run in Windows or Linux, this app uses ffmpeg for decoding/encoding videos.  The Linux version handles videos with HDR on the gpu where the windows version will use CPU for the HDR portion.  So I am doing some testing before making the full move.I currently have the GPU passed into a Windows Guest.  Works great rebooting the vm card starts no problem extra.So Installed, Ubuntu Desktop first, installed the app and copied some videos that are 4K HDR for testing.  Without the GPU the app was working without issue as best it could CPU rendering the videos pegs the vm cpu.  So I shut down both the windows guest and ubuntu guest.  removed the P4000 from the Windows VM and attached it to the Ubuntu VM.  Powered on, installed drivers, rebooted. Got No display on the VM…(I should have expected that actually).  removed the card to install SSH Server so I can at least have terminal.  After powering back up I had display on the vm and testing the app would through errors trying to start it’s encoding/decoding process.  So while trying to figure out why I was having issues with the app in linux I put the GPU back to the Windows Guest and powered it back on.  Only to find it wasn’t working either now.  In Device manager the card had a code 43 error. after failing to get the device to start in windows I decided to reboot the entire host.  Which solved the issue with the windows guest.  So I decided to got back to my testing of the Ubuntu Guest and I was able to get everything to work (no display on the VM still), but I wasnt’ done.  I wanted to test the functionality on Ubuntu Server as well so I powered off the Ubuntu Guest, Swithed VHD’s to the server and powered it on and same thing again won’t run the app’s process and the Windows Guest again has code 43 error.In linux I was using the 510 driver package, on windows i’m using a 47X driver.  I’ve not tired with the 470 driver package on Linux yet, but I am planning on it.  But my question is, is there a setting in the linux drivers that cause a part of the card to stop that is reset during reboot of the physical machine.  And if there is, how do I disable it.  Or is the an issue with the 510 package.Hi,Windows Server Core OS is not supported at all as a host. Most likely causes the issues…regards\\nSimonPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Depending on your requirements, maybe something like VNC. Or if you’d prefer to use RDP, then connect to the VM via SSH and install XRDP to allow RDP connectivity.RegardsMGTitan doesn’t support virtualization at all.Hi MrGRID,I have install the NVIDIA driver in my hyper-V Ubuntu Linux 18.04.2 LTS OS VM and I am connecting to the VM using RDP.\\nThe NVIDIA driver version I have installed is 430.34 for Linux 64-bit OS.\\nBut I still encounter the same error when running the nvidia-smi command as below:Does this mean I am not able to use the Titan RTX GPU in my hyper-V Ubuntu Linux VM with the standard NVIDIA drivers?Thanks and Regards,\\nYiYangHi sschaber,Titan doesn’t support virtualization at all.Is it mean if I am using the Hyper-V Ubuntu Linux VM, I must have the vGPU drivers and NVIDIA GPU that support virtualization in order for the NVIDIA GPU to work in the VM?Thanks and regards,\\nYiYangIt means that Titan (consumer product) is not enabled for virtualization (including Passthrough) and therefore it is not working or at least not supported.Hi sschaber,Does it means that only GPUs, like Tesla V100/P100, RTX6000/8000, can be passed through to the linux vm and work properly with standard NVIDIA driver?Should I install vGPU driver in linux vm or standard GPU driver is OK?HiThe GPUs listed here are supported for vGPU: Supported Products :: NVIDIA Virtual GPU Software DocumentationPassthrough GPUs are Quadro P2000 and above.Don’t confuse vGPU with Passthrough, they are not the same.RegardsMGHello,My environment is;\\nHost: Windows Server 2019\\nGPU: NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti\\nGuest system: Hyper-V Ubuntu Linux 20.04I have the same problem with YiYang.I have spend like 18 hours to solve this problem.

Because as a company we bought 2 2080Ti for AI.What we want is we need 1 prod VM and 1 test VM. Both GPUs should usable for those 2 VMs.RegardsHiUnfortunately you should have purchased Quadro or Tesla GPUs if you need to virtualise them. GeForce are Consumer GPUs and do not support virtualisation.Best advice, send them back to where you purchased them from and purchase a pair of RTX 5000 / 6000 or 8000 GPUs. These can be used in either Passthrough without a vGPU license and a standard Quadro driver, or you can use them with vGPU and run multiple instances per GPU (which does requires a license).RegardsMGThank you so much for the advise.We’ll change the GPU’s and probably we ll buy 2x RTX5000. Supported Products :: NVIDIA Virtual GPU Software Documentation at this document i can’t see RTX5000 i think this is not updated document.So with RTX 5000 we can attach both GPU’s to multiple VMs.For example:1 Prod VM\\n1 Test VM2 GPU’s memory is fully available to use sometimes for Prod VM and sometimes for Test VM.Have I got it right?I’ve bought a Quadro P2200 card and it is also not working with Discrete Device Assignment.

       " 'motherboard-support-for-tesla-t4': 'I have an ASUS Prime Z390-A Motherboard LGA1151 and I’m wondering what the easiest way to verify if it does or does not support a 16GB graphics card.  If it is supported, does anyone know what settings I would need to adjust in Bios to enable the card?HiThat’s a Consumer grade motherboard you’ve listed, so I’m assuming you’ll be installing it inside a Tower chassis and not a rack mount chassis. The Tesla T4 (that you mentioned in the heading) is a datacenter grade GPU and is Passively cooled, so is completely unsuitable for a Tower chassis.If you need a 16GB GPU to go with the motherboard you’ve listed (assuming in a Tower chassis), a more suitable choice would be an RTX 5000 (Turing) or P5000 (Pascal), as these are both Actively cooled. For around the same sort of money, you might then also consider a TITAN RTX (Turing / 24GB), however this is a Prosumer level GPU not a Professional one (like the RTX 5000 / P5000). It depends on your use case as to whether this is suitable.Regarding BIOS changes, you shouldn’t need to make any. However, if your system doesn’t boot, then check out the \"Above 4G Decoding\" setting.RegardsMGI’ve got a cooling solution for the T4 that seems to be working fairly well for temps (using a thermaltake p3 case with a GPU tray and a couple be:Quiet fans).  I can use other GPUs as well, but I’d like to occasionally do some testing with a T4 as that’s the hardware platform I’m targeting, and it would be nice to have one in my desktop.I see options for ‘Above 4G …’ on a co-worker’s motherboard but don’t seem to see a similar setting on the ASUS Prime Z390-A.Thanks for the help MrGRID, I’m convinced after a little more googling for ‘Above 4G Decoding’ that as you say the card should ‘just work’ with this motherboard.  I’m going to try testing with a 2070 I have (8GB) and suspect that will work out of the box, which should rule out bios or motherboard compatibility as the source of my issues.kellensunderlandvirtgpu - How did it work out?

My application creates one or more OpenGL contexts per user for remote rendering, but it does this in a single VM. It does not use common RDI infrastructure like RDP, it is a proprietary system.

For sure you will need a license for your use case. It is required to have at least a vPC license or a vWS license if you need a profile with more FB or CUDA support.\\nNVIDIA doesn’t sell directly so you need to go to Distis or OEMs that are able to resell NV licenses.\\nBTW: T4 seems to be the right GPU :)regards\\nSimonThanks for your answer, Simon. I think part of the problem with the licensing guide for me is that it frustrates me how much of the advantage of vGPU that is chopped off by having to deal with a complicated license model. If you could take a humble wish back to the product managers it would be to drop this per-VM multiple types of clients licensing mess and just recoup the revenue loss by making the data center GPUs (even) more expensive.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Ok, no issue Perfect stable frame rates at this 4K DSR. No lag at all. But here’s here come the problem. When I finished gaming and I just want to shut down the computer or even do a restart. Now, when the computer freshly booted. and I jumped back to my game, which of course the settings was saved. was saved at 4K. last time. Now the game stutters like crazy. and constant lagging. It is like the GPU doesn’t recognize the resolution after a restart or shut down the only solution that I came up so far is I have to change the resolution back to 1080p from the game settings and not only that still it is present but when I send it to 1080p and the next step I have to restart my computer in order to the GPU res Self and became afresh. boot kernel. Now when I jump back the game if you remember now it should be 1080p because before the shutdown or before the restart in order to overcome this issue, I have changed back to 10 adp. Now there is no problem that game works fine run fine. And then like the first time I can now change back from the menu of the game to the 4KDSR factors that I have specified before. Now again the game runs fine perfectly with No. issue. Now here. to come again the cycle. when I shut down the computer again or I just want to quit and do a restart now because the game settings save it at 4K. now when I jump back to a game after a restart or shut down it is like the first I’ve talked about it It will be constantly lagging and stuttering. So like I said, it is look like the graphic card doesn’t recognize the 4K DSR after a clean restart or shut down. now and before you respond to me I. have done literally everything fresh. clean windows install up the GPU drivers try different games and by the way it doesn’t happen with every game.

Use my link above, use the following details:Product Type: Quadro\\nProduct Series: Quadro Series\\nProduct: P4000\\nOperating System: Windows 10 64-bit\\nWindows Driver Type: Standard\\nDownload Type: ODEThat’s the driver you need :-)Remember to set the GPU to \"Passthrough\" mode in vSphere so you can allocate it to the VM. The vSphere Host will need a reboot for it to take effect, after which you’ll be able to allocate it to your VM and install the driver.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",
       " 'nvidia-vgpu-grid-profile-is-missing': 'Hello, my organisation want to use vGPU.We use VMWare vSphere 7.03 and vCenter 7.03. I allready have installed the driver over putty and the command nvidia-smi shows me the graphics card. The Problem is, that i can`t choose a profile in the configuration of the VM. I can choose nvidia grid, but thats all.I have allready activate shared direct in the GPU Settings of the host. Direct IO is activatet too. The persistence-mode is on.Can anyone help me with this issue?Which GPU? Which server? Which driver version?\\nA bit more detail would help to get a better responseRegards SimonIts an Quadro RTX 8000 in an Intel 3.Gen Server with ESXi 7.03.The driver number is 14.1 (510.73.06) in the license portal.Hi,thanks for the additional information. But it would still be helpful to know which server (OEM, type). We have a HCL and only supported systems are tested. Often there are specific BIOS settings (MMIO, Above 4G and others) necessary, the OEM needs to advise in order to run the GPU properly with vGPU profiles.Download NVIDIA GRID datasheets, guides, solution overviews, white papers, and success stories. Watch GRID videos, webinars, and webcasts.In your specific case do you also have the Enterprise Plus license from vSphere in place?\\nSometimes there is also an issue if you only have the GPU in one host in a cluster. You need to make sure that the VM is located on the right host, otherwise you also won’t see the profiles.Best regards\\nSimonHey,its an Intel Serverbarebone R2208WFTZSR with two Intel XEON Gold 6244.Can you tell me what kind of bios settings are need to see the profiles?Yes i have an Enterprise Plus license. There is no cluster at the moment. I have create an Datacenter in VCenter, but there is only one Host.Do you need more informations?Greetings\\nTobiasHard to say. Really depends on the OEM BIOS. But you could check this document from an example:This is part 2 of a series of blog articles on the subject of using GPUs with VMware vSphere. Part 1 of this series presents an overview of the various options for using GPUs on vSphere Part 2 describes the DirectPath I/O (Passthrough) mechanism for...\\nEst. reading time: 11 minutes\\n\\nAbove 4G decode needs to be enabled as example.Thanks for the details. I try it tomorrow, when i am in the office.I think there some options not configured in the BIOS.Hello,so i made it work now, but if I restart the vSphere Server its gone and the only way to solved this issue is to reinstall the driver.The driver couldn`t found by nvidia-smi. The only way to find the driver is first to activate passtrough and then to deactivet it.Unfortunately I assume this is related to the host you are using. This is not tested/supported and therefore there is not much we can do. There is the HCL for good reason. Please try to get some certified servers after your evaluation period to avoid such issues.Download NVIDIA GRID datasheets, guides, solution overviews, white papers, and success stories. Watch GRID videos, webinars, and webcasts.Best regards\\nSimonThe server from Wortmann TERRA SERVER 7220 G3 is supported by VMWare (HCL). Its only the Intel Barebone whats used.You can see it here:\\nhttps://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php?deviceCategory=server&details=1&partner=93&releases=578&keyword=TERRA%20SERVER%207220%20G3&systemTypes=2&cpuSeries=128&page=1&display_interval=10&sortColumn=Partner&sortOrder=AscYesterday i had a call with VMWare support and they toke a look in the logs and make sure that all is configured the right way. The problem can´t solved by them. They say, there are no problems in VMWare and they think thats an Firmware Problem of the card who makes this issue.Do you have any idea?Sorry but I’m not talking about the VMWare HCL. As long as the server is not on our HCL it is not tested for GPUs and therefore not supported/working.\\nWe don’t have firmware issues and there is no option for customers to modify the firmware (as not needed) so the VMWare response is not helpful nor correct.\\nPlease check the link I posted previously with our HCL. If your server is not present there we cannot do anything further.regards\\nSimonPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",
       " 'tesla-t4-graphical-errors-virtual-desktops-1903': 'Hi FolksI’ve already opened a case with NVIDIA and also with Citrix for this. But they don’t have an idea what causes the problems yet. So I thought maybe someone here has an idea or recommendation.Since we updated to Citrix 1903 and NVIDIA GRID drivers 9.0, we randomly get graphic errors inside XenDesktop Sessions (Please see the screenshot).This issue can be reproduced when moving windows around inside a XenDesktop session. The graphical errors mostly persist until I resize the Citrix Session Windows or switch from fulscreen to window mode and back.Enviroment:Hypervisor: VMware ESXi 6.5 latest patch\\nVirtualization: Citrix XenDesktop 1903\\nGuest OS: Windows 10 1803\\nNVIDIA Host driver: 430.27\\nNVIDIA Guest Driver: 431.02\\nCitrix Workspace App: 1905Please see the screenshot in the link for configuration settings which are applied.I’ve also tested with Citrix VDA 1811 and 1906, same problem. With VDA 7.15 the issue does not occur, but we recognized a way better performance, quality and also latency with VDA 1903. That’s why we want to upgrade to 1903, it’s a big improvement for our virtual AutoCAD workspaces.NVIDIA Support mentioned the following thing:\"As I mentioned, starting with Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops 7 1903 version, Citrix remoting implementation has changed from using NVFBC to using DDAPI.\"If anybody has an idea I would be happy to hear some of them.Regards, CedyHiHave you tried running a newer version of Windows 10? The version you’re running is over a year old now, try a test build on 1903 and see if that makes a difference.RegardsMGFirst of all I would suggest to check the Framebuffer usage. Sounds like FB exhausting effects. Our support is right in terms of NVFBC / DDAPI so this can have a huge impact. DDAPI is meant for at least RS5 so I would also suggest to move to latest Win10 build first.regards\\nSimonThanks for the advicesI will give 1903 a try today.Regards, CedyJust tested with Windows 10 1903, VDA 1903 and NVIDIA Driver 431.02.The problems still exist, so Windows 10 version is not the reason for the issues.Any other ideas?\\n\\nUnbenannt.JPG2485×607 141 KB\\nI did some more tests on this.Seems like I am not able to reproduce the issues with P4 and VDA 1903/1906.2.So it is definitly a Tespla T4 / CVDA 1903/1906.2 issue…Performance and latency is way better with T4, but not usable with the graphical issues.Hi,I can confirm these issues also exist on our setup:\\nHypervisor: VMware ESXi 6.7 U2\\nGuest OS: Windows Server 2019\\nNVIDIA Host driver: 430.46\\nNVIDIA Guest Driver: 431.79Not too aware of the actual Citrix versions…Oh this is also an a Tesla T4 setup.\\nYou can quickly test for these artifacts by visiting the site https://www.mumfordandsons.com/ where the background video behaves like a severly scratched DivX movie CD (long trails behind objects, tearing all over the place.)Got same problem, same HDX settings, same GPU card.\\nDisabling HW encoding make the artifacts go away, but we bought that card with a purpose.Wondering if anyone has a solution by now?There is no solution atm. This is a Citrix issue with hardware decode YUV444 on their current Citrix receivers. Please open a support ticket with Citrix. They are well aware of this and are working on a fix.\\nSimply create a screenshot in the session when the issue occurs and you will see, that you won’t see any corruption in the screenshot later…Hi sschaber,Do you have a ticket ID we can reference at Citrix?\\nWe’re seeing similar issues, but we are not using YUV444/AlwaysLossLess.\\nDo you know with what Citrix Workspace App version the issues started? Perhaps a workaround could be to use one of the older versions.Thanks,KoenraadHi,we have the same issues on our CAD VDIs. Any news from Citrix about that?Thanks\\nKorbinianYes, there is a private fix available from Citrix (new workspace app). Please contact Citrix to get the required bits.Regards\\nSimonHi, we have similar issues with M60 YUV444/AlwaysLossLess Settings. Case is opened and they confirmed that they have a known issue regarding T4 but not M60 will test the new Workspace App and report back here.Hi, we are still waiting to get the fixed Workspace App version from Citrix for testing.Hi Gormat,I can guarantee that you won’t be affected by this issue with Tesla M60! The new workspace app added support for multiframe encode which was introduced with Turing (T4) architecture.You should test with a bigger framebuffer profile first to see if your issue is related to framebuffer exhaust, which is the issue I see most.regards\\nSimonCitrix told me to test the 1911, you can download it from https://www.citrix.com/en-in/downloads/workspace-app/windows/workspace-app-for-windows-latest.htmlDidnt had time to test it yet.@sschaber, sorry didnt saw that we already have a second page :-)Thank you for the input. But the looks like the same as the opening post. Are you sure?Br\\nMat1911 is not correct. You need a private build…Hi sschaber do you have any Case number or something i can refer to?Thank youBr\\nMatFYI - this is addressed in Citrix Workspace App 2006.1 and above under fixID: RFWIN-14188Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'rtx-4000-in-passthrough-in-vsphere-6-7': 'Hi! I am using the RTX 4000 in vSphere 6.7 and assigned the adapter to the VM as PCI device ( 4 devices ). I installed the NVIDIA drivers in Windows 2016 VM. But when I RDP into the system and click on the Display properties it’s telling me I am using Generic Monitor ( that’s fine ) and using a MS drivers. Under the Device Manager I have disabled the VMware SVGA 3D adapter and left the RTX 4000 enabled. I am not able to change the resolution and also not able to add the GPU option in Task Manager to view the GPU utilization. Please help!HiWhen installing VMTools, you should have unselected the SVGA driver so it wasn’t installed.You need to change your connection protocol to something other than RDP. HDX, Blast, PCoIP, TGX, VNC will allow you to use the GPU properly.Regarding resolution, if using RDP you set that before you connect, you don’t change it while your session is open. If using one of the other protocols, you can simply \"full screen\" the window and the internal resolution will automatically resize to match that of your physical monitor. Or you can manually drag the window to a size you want and the resolution will automatically adjust to the size of the window. There’s no need to manually set the resolution within the VM.RegardsMGThanks for the reply! Is there any way I can see the GPU tab in Task Manager in Windows 2016. I searched and searched but not able to find an answer. Also, the NVIDIA Control Panel setting \"Usage Mode\" \"Use for Graphics and compute needs\" option is per user or can Administrator set this for all users in a Terminal Server (Remote Desktop Services)?HiNo, Windows 2016 is too old. Windows 2019 or Windows 10 have that feature.You can use this application if you wish to see GPU metrics: Releases · JeremyMain/GPUProfiler · GitHubI believe an Admin can set that mode in a RDSH when connected with an appropriate protocol.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

This is expected behavior see - Quick Start Guide :: NVIDIA Virtual GPU Software DocumentationDOK so I see the statement: “VM console in vSphere Web Client is not supported in this vGPU release. Therefore, use VMware Horizon or VNC to access the VM’s desktop.” That makes troubleshooting the VM really difficult. For example, I have an issue right now where one VM doesn’t reboot cleanly from a nightly scheduled reboot task. It just gets stuck somewhere half-way as its shutting down. RDP & VNV dont work, but I can still ping it. Without the console, I cannot see what is causing the problem.Is NVidia going to fix this bug??? VM Console is a fundamental part of administering a  vmware environment!I understand your frustration.  The fix to the bug requires a change to the “VM Console in vSphere”  which NVIDIA does not have control of.  I have raised the issue internally to see if we get this issue addressed with vmware.HiRemove the GPU from the VM, power it back on before its nightly automated shutdown and let it run through it’s automated shutdown process and hang. You can then use the Console to view the VM. Once the issue is resolved, reattached the GPU and carry on as normal. If it reboots cleanly without the VM attached, this will give you an area to investigate once you reattach it.RegardsMGDisable the VM Console is a stupid design.So feed this feedback to your VMWare contacts. The more customers complain, the better the chance that VMWare would change their console access behavior. All other hypervisors have a solution for this.Regards SimonPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

This really makes a difference as you would need a different driver (vGPU driver) + licenses if running the passive one.

Or should the driver from the enterprise area work?\\nNVIDIA Licensing Portal (here there is a lower driver version)\\n11-03-2022_13-18-051479×1159 146 KB\\nCorrect, you need the driver from NV licensing portal. As you can see in GPUProfiler, the GPU is running in TCC mode so it is definitely a passive RTX (datacenter GPU) and therefore the public driver is only capable to do compute on Windows. For WDDM support you need the vGPU driver from the NV portal and then it will switch to WDDM mode and should work as expected. You can buy the vApps licenses from Dell (1vApps per CCU running on the RDSH). As you seem to have already access to the portal you should also got a 90 trial automatically…Thank you.\\nWith the vGPU driver from the NV portal it is working.

We don’t have ‘high-end’ CAD users but the occasional user wants to use mapping software, or someone else may want to make a promotional video or some-such, so, we’ve begun dipping our toes into NVIDIA GPU world…And struggling to be honest!I think we’re at the point where we have two options…M10s for ‘everyone’ (I believe these offer maximum density and whilst they are fine at the moment we need to consider moving forwards) and T4s for the more ‘power users’.I understand that we need to licence the software (vPC stuff?) per CCU - so in our instance would we need 1,800 licences or 1,000?I’ve been reading about core count vs clock speed - Am I correct in assuming that anything over 3.0GHz base (not turbo) should be just fine?What’s really confusing us is the relationship between the Physical Hosts, the virtual Windows Server 201x RDSH hosts (more than one per physical host) and the actual sessions people connect to (many per virtual 201x host). For example we have a pool of 522 users spread across 35 virtual Windows Server 201x guests on 9 physical hosts.In addition the same hosts support a (small-ish) number of ‘real’ VM’s for people who have ‘wonky stuff’ to run :-)My further understanding is that a Vib is needed within vSphere/ESX and that driver software is needed on the RDSH guests - is this correct?Does anyone have any thoughts/recommendations for pointing us in a direction of travel that means we can get to where we need to be - supporting the 90% people to have a ‘better’ experience and future proofing us and allowing the 10% of people actually do what they need to do?I hope this is enough information - if not, ask and I’ll get what you need!Many thanks in advancePatHey PatFirstly, before you do anything hardware related, check over the application requirements to see how it uses the resources. It may be able to use multiple Cores, it may put more emphasis on the GPU or it may just want a single high speed core, or a bit of everything. If you can’t find it in the system requirements documentation, contact the software vendor and ask them directly, you can then look at appropriate hardware to support it.If the application is single thread limited, then yes, to make life much easier for yourself, focus on the base Clock and forget Turbo. It’s obviously possible to get Turbo to work in a virtualised environment, but there are many hoops to jump through, and to be honest, it’s not worth the hassle. Then you’re into Single Core Boost vs All Core Boost (they have different levels of Boost depending on how many Cores Boost at the same time, and this is dependant on all sorts of variables as well) and trying to keep them engaged so you don’t get peaky performance, it’s just a real pain to work with when virtualising and it’s far easier just to opt for a high Base Clock from the start and not have to worry about it. For CAD applications that are predominantly single threaded, 3.0Ghz would be the minimum I’d work with whilst maintaining a balance vs Cores. For example, there are Xeons that have a higher base Clock, but you’re compromised on Core count. The best balance at the moment is the Gen 2 Scalable Xeon Gold 6254, which is 18 Cores @ 3.1Ghz. You can obviously trade up or down (Core vs Clock) depending on your requirements, but this is the sweet spot in my opinion.Regarding vGPU Licensing … It’s really simple … vApps, vPC, QvDWS are all licensed Per CCU. So if you have 1800 users, but only 1000 connect to the platform at any one time, then you only need 1000 licenses. As for the type of license, if you’re running RDSH you’ll want vApps, for your normal single user Windows VMs, you’ll need vPC and for your 3D Workstations you’ll potentially want QvDWS depending on the application requirements. All of those are Per CCU.Honestly … Forget the M10 at this stage. You can absolutely still buy it and it will be supported, but unless you already have them and are looking to scale out an already existing M10 deployment, give them a miss at this stage. They’re superseded 3 times architecture wise and are lacking in features and functionality compared to the current generation. From what you’ve said above about the majority of your user base being Knowledge Workers (Now referred to as \"Digital Workers\") and that you don’t have any high-end CAD users, you should be looking at T4s for all of your workloads. You can use the same model of GPU, but use the Profiles to allow different amounts of performance, for example:RDSH VMs will use the T4-8A and you’ll have 2 of those per T4.Single User VMs will have either the T4-1B or T4-2B depending on your requirements, and you’ll have 8 or 16 of those per T4.3D Single User VMs \"could\" have T4-4Q and you’ll have 4 of those per T4.You mention HP above (I’m assuming this is your server platform), but don’t mention what your server hardware or generation is (DL380 Gx … ?). If you were planning on purchasing completely new HP hardware, then you can speak to your partner about the appropriate configuration, if retro fitting GPUs into existing servers, firstly make sure they’re supported, the BIOS and Firmware are fully updated, then purchase appropriate PSUs, PCIe Risers, GPU Enablement Kits (low profile heatsink for CPUs, and GPU power cables if needed) and potentially high-performance fans and also the GPUs. When working with vGPU, it’s important to have an up to date software stack, this includes Hypervisor, Management (vCenter in your case), Operating System and vGPU Drivers. This prevents a lot of issues and allows the best performance and functionality. Before proceeding with vGPU, you need to check your licensing situation. For VMware, at a minimum you’ll want vCenter Standard and vSphere Enterprise and ideally, you’ll be running 6.7U3.Before setting up vGPU, make sure you get your vGPU License Server built and then vGPU licenses ordered through your Partner. Licenses can sometimes take up to 24hrs to arrive in your NVIDIA Portal, so best to get that kicked off from the start as your vGPUs have very limited (unusable) performance until licensed.As per your question, the vGPU software comes in two parts. A .vib is required to be installed in each physical vSphere Host that will be running vGPU (this is referred to as the vGPU Manager), this will allow you to allocate vGPU profiles to your VMs through vCenter. The second part is a driver that goes inside the Windows / Linux OS.Regarding configuration, it’s relatively strait forward with some extremely basic maths to workout approximate user capacity per VM as a ballpark number to aim for pending a POC where you can firm things up. These are very general guidelines, and there are a lot of variables to consider, but on average, you should be aiming for 20 - 25 concurrent users per vGPU enabled RDSH VM (sometimes it’s slightly more, sometimes it’s slightly less), and 2 VMs per T4. This is really going to depend on your applications, how the users use those applications, platform and system hardware including hardware generations and overall optimisations etc etc. If we take the lower of those two numbers (which combined is 40 (2 VMs each with 20 users)) as a working number, we can workout how many GPUs we’ll need to support 1000 concurrent users, and by default, how may servers we’ll need to support X number of GPUs.1000 (Users) / 40 (Users Per GPU) = 25 (GPUs Required)(This bit would be handy to know your server hardware and generation, so I’m just going to use the current Gen10 …)HP DL380 G10 will support 5 T4 GPUs ( Qualified System Catalog | NVIDIA ).25 (GPUs) / 5 (The capacity of a DL380 G10) = 5 (DL380 G10 each with 5 T4 GPUs, each supporting 40 users)So what this means, is that if you’re able to support 20 users per RDSH VM, and get 2 of those on 1 T4, then you’ll want 25 T4 GPUs, and 5 DL380 G10 servers to support it.This scales up / down either way. If you can get 25 users on a VM, that’s 50 users per T4, long story short, you only need 4 DL380s instead of 5. If you can only get 4 T4s in your existing server hardware, then you’re going to need more DL380s etc etc … And don’t forget your N+1 for resilience and maintenance windows, or every time you want to work on a Host, you’ll be doing it out of hours, or removing it from service and impacting your total usable capacity … ;-)FYI, your limiting factor will be vGPU Framebuffer, as you’ll split the T4 into 2 8GB vGPU Profiles and run the RDSH VMs with 8GB, and you’ll be using the T4-8A vGPU Profile.Now, as you’ll also have single user desktop VMs, as well as your 3D Workstation VMs, what I would do is run all of your RDSH VMs in a dedicated vSphere Cluster, that way there are no vGPU Profile issues and it makes scaling, migration and management really easy. Then create a second vSphere Cluster for your single user VMs that have a different vGPU Profile (Probably T4-2B), and depending on how many 3D Workstations you need you may even want a 3rd vSphere Cluster to support that vGPU Profile. It is possible to manage that from a single Cluster using the breadth first / depth first configuration settings in vCenter (Performance vs Density), and if you wanted to do that, you’d be constantly running in \"Density\" mode, so up to you how you’d like to configure it.The reason it can be better to split out the vGPU Profiles into dedicated Clusters, is that you can’t mix Profiles on the same physical GPU. So if a VM with a particular profile starts up on a GPU, only other VMs with the same Profile can use that specific GPU. Despite a lot of customer frustration, this does make sense. For example, a vPC workload assumes a different workload to QvDWS or vApps, so why would you run those on the same GPU, or in some instances, even the same physical server? We also need to remember, that this isn’t about cramming as many users onto a single physical server as is humanly possible, this is about giving the best user experience whilst still delivering a cost effective solution. If anyone wants to cram users on to the platform to the detriment of the user experience, then simply remove the GPU from the system altogether and you can do just that.Right, I’ve rattled on for long enough. I hope at least some of that is useful. As said, recalculate some of those numbers and apply what’s useful to your own environment and hardware. Let me know if you’d like more detail about anything …RegardsMGMGThanks so much for the information - helps massively.HP…yes we have a mix HP DL380 Gen9 and Gen 8 … ideally I’d be looking to get the budget for a number of new machines and buy brand new completely configured HP Gen10’s with 5 T4’s each as that seems to be the sweet spot.We currently have 0 GPU offering for our users and a handful are ‘not very happy’ (to quote you, above, ‘If anyone wants to cram users on to the platform to the detriment of the user experience, then simply remove the GPU from the system altogether and you can do just that.’) - that’s pretty much where we are.For the VAST majority of users what we’ve given them is just fine, but as we’ve been rolling out we’ve been putting ‘problem use cases’ to the end, and, well we’re pretty close to the end and have to revist the last 10%!if I could get the budget for at least two machines (we have two sites) then, from the above, I should be able to get in the order of 40 users happy.From what you’ve said above though it sounds like I should be pushing for four machines - 2 for an RDSH ‘Cluster’ of 2019 (for 2 sites) that will support 40-ish users and a further 2 for dedicated VMs with, again, 40 (or 80 depending on config) per machine.There are no 3D users as such, just planners who like complicated maps … I will try to gain more info on the spec of the machines they would expect to run on non-virtually.Is there a URL of which you are aware that explains these vGPU profiles?Oh I meant to say - it’s all on Nimble Flash storage (which is good :-) )Seriously, thank you again.PatHi PatNo worries, glad the info is usefulWhen designing each cluster, try and keep the server hardware as similar as possible (ideally identical) as this keeps performance, functionality and density the same no matter which VM the users connect to.Use the numbers I’ve mentioned above as a guide to get started, your best bet would be to work with your technology supplier and get a DL380 Gen10 on evaluation, run a small POC on it with each type of VM and work out which specs of each are correct for you, then reconfigure it and purchase accordingly.The main vGPU Documentation Site is available here: NVIDIA Virtual GPU (vGPU) Software DocumentationThe current release is vGPU 10.1. If you select that, it will open up all the documentation for that specific version. The document you’re looking for with all the vGPU Profiles is called “Virtual GPU Software User Guide”. Open that and scroll down a few pages and you’ll see all the Profiles listed in a few big tables.If you’re looking at physical workstation specs, it’s well worth doing a little monitoring to check utilisation to make sure you cover off any unforeseen requirements. This is my favourite monitoring software: Releases · JeremyMain/GPUProfiler · GitHub It’s free to use and will give you plenty of accurate metrics to work with.To save you a bit of troubleshooting, when you GPU enable your RDSH VMs, you must set this GPO for them, otherwise the RDSH VMs won’t use the GPU:Computer Configuration\\\\Administrative Templates\\\\Windows Components\\\\Remote Desktop Services\\\\Remote Desktop Session Host\\\\Remote Session Environment: Use the hardware default graphics adapters for all Remote Desktop Services sessionsNice work with the All Flash!

We then pass the captured frames to NVENC and handle the h264-encoded frames ourselves. Our program is multithreaded, with a main thread and separate threads for video and audio capture. Our NVFBC implementation is almost verbatim from NvFBCToGLEnc.c from the samples included with the latest NVIDIA Capture SDK.

We decided that we would venture into testing some vGPU in different use cases so we bought 8 new Cisco UCS B200 M5 blades with 2 x I6248R CPU, 512GB of RAM and a single P6 in each blade. All blades are connected to a Pure x70 all flash array.My question is, would it be possible to run the same ~800 CCU RDSH farm on these new blades and if so what would be feasible profiles for the P6s? Do we build the same number of servers and assign them the 4A profile or can we get by with a 2A or 1A profile given that the current environment doesn’t have graphics at all?Since we are new to this and bought this setup for testing purposes for various applications I am just curious if it is possible to run our largest farm with vGPU and maintain our user density.Hi ADTThe B200 M5 supports 2x P6 GPUs and it’s worth running that configuration so you can maximise the density. You should be looking at either 8A or 16A vGPU Profiles meaning that with 2x P6 installed, you’ll have 2x (16A) or 4x (8A) RDSH VMs per Blade. Don’t use anything less than 8A with RDSH VMs in a production environment.The following link is targeted at Citrix XenApp, but it relates directly to your use case as well. Have a read all the way through, as I believe you’ll find the information useful in understanding what kind of configurations to go for and the pitfalls of sizing the vGPU Profiles incorrectly: https://gridforums.nvidia.com/default/topic/10042/xenapp/looking-for-advice-on-optimal-config-for-latest-gen-citrix-xenapp-vgpu-solution/RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

I use single RTX 6000 card, so can i buy 5 vWDS and 25 vPC for license mixing? If can not mix license like that, I have to mix type of cards on same server (1 RTX card for vWDS and 1 M10 card for vPC)?Thank You for your help!HiYou can’t mix licenses / profiles on the same GPU. So run your high-end users on a single RTX 6000 and your other users on a more appropriate GPU, maybe an M10 or 2x T4.RegardsMGDear Sir,Thank for your responding. So that mean we can mix 2 type of physical card on the same server? Or have to install 2 same cards on same server then assign license (vPC, vDWS) to each card?HiYou should be installing the same type of GPU in a single server. Mixing different types of GPU in the same server is not supported.You can run different vGPU license types for each GPU within the same server. For example, the first GPU could run RTX vWS (formerly QvDWS). The second GPU could run vPC, and so on … depending on how many GPUs are installed.However, this design is still not optimal, as high-end users and standard users require different types of CPU and other technologies due to their workloads, so bundling mixed workloads on the same server is definitely sub-optimal, however it is clearly possible. If budget allows, the workloads should be split out to run on more focused types of hardware.Hope that makes sense.RegardsMGDear Support Team,Thank your very much for your supporting.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

I’m a bit surprised this is still somewhat uncharted grounds and no \"experts\" can advise a definitive course of action/software to use.HiIt’s not that it’s uncharted grounds, it’s that software has different requirements depending on it’s purpose, and as you have 3 different bits of software that undoubtedly do different things (especially in a modern CCTV system), they may all have different requirements, so the easiest thing to do is validate exactly what you need with a quick Eval.Are you Training? Inferencing? Rendering? All of them?If you’re rendering or want accelerated video then you may want QvDWS. If you’re only Inferencing / Training then vCS will be fine.

I just get the error: The maximum number of devices of this type has been reached, what am I doing wrong?You’re funny man. Add more GPUs. How do you want to add multiple T4s if you have only 1 physical GPU present?Hi SSDGood progress so far, nice work getting it up and running :-)Yes, within vCenter you need to change to \"Shared Direct\" for vGPU to be enabled, the other setting is for Passthrough which you aren’t using in this instance. This is a \"Per Host\" setting, not \"Per Cluster\", so you’ll need to set it on all VX Nodes that have a GPU in.Regarding vGPU Profiles, the number in the Profile equates to Framebuffer. 1 = 1GB / 2 = 2GB / 4 = 4GB / 8 = 8GB / 16 = 16GB. Other GPUs can go higher as they have more Framebuffer (24 / 32 / 40 / 48).With vGPU, you hard allocate the framebuffer per VM, but share the GPU processing / encoding / decoding cycles between VMs. What this means is that if you want to run 4 VMs at the same time, the maximum Profile size you can use with a 16GB GPU is 4GB. In case you aren’t aware, detailed documentation is available from here: NVIDIA Virtual GPU (vGPU) Software Documentation The vGPU Software User Guide lists all the available Profiles per GPU (as well as other information) and is worth having a read through: Virtual GPU Software User Guide :: NVIDIA Virtual GPU Software DocumentationWhat I would do in this instance, is start off with a well spec’d VM. Give it 8 vCPUs, 16GB (System) RAM and a 16Q vGPU Profile (Quadro, not Compute) at this stage and run each of the applications independently (1 VM at a time as it’s a 16GB Profile) to build up an understanding of how the application uses the hardware and what kind of resources it needs. Using the \"Q\" Profile means that you’re enabling all of the GPUs features and performance and as you’ll only be testing 1 VM at a time, you can allocate all of the Framebuffer. Once the Application is working and you are happy with performance and have tailored the resources (CPU / RAM / GPU Framebuffer), you can then change the GPUs Profile to a \"C\" and run the same tests to see what the differences are. You can then decide which vGPU Profile (C or Q) is appropriate for each Application. Be aware though, I see that the website mentions the Application can make use of multiple GPUs, which means that it may be quite heavy, meaning you could end up requiring an entire T4 per VM purely for processing cycles. Your testing will give you the results and you can then decide how to proceed.To help you with resource monitoring, you can use a tool called \"GPU Profiler\": Releases · JeremyMain/GPUProfiler · GitHubOnce your testing is complete, you should have a complete Resource Profile for each of the Applications. Each Application may require different amounts of resources depending on what it’s doing, so don’t assume they will all be the same. This includes CPU, RAM and GPU. GPU Profiler can help with monitoring all of those at the same time and will create a nice graph you can save and refer to later on. However, if the Application is also Multi-Threaded on the CPU, then just use (Windows) Task Manager to see what each Thread is doing and whether you need to scale up or down on the CPU side.Don’t forget to optimize Windows as well: VMware OS Optimization Tool | VMware FlingsLet me know how you get on …(FYI - I’m UK based, so there’s a bit of a time difference between us ;-) )RegardsMGWow awesome information thanks MG, I had worked out the vGPU’s profiles Framebuffer size, did not know about the Q=Quadro.As budget would allow this card is going to be doing all the work on one 128GB Mem 4xCPU VM, so we are going to simply try giving the vGPU’s 4GB profile (NVIDIA GRID vGPU grid_t4-4c) each to begin with and tune from there, thanks for the link to GPU profiler etc. this will come in handy.We only have this 1 Host with the T4 GPU card, so its kinda on its own running 1 VM, any changes i make is to the Host alone, not the cluster.I hadnt seen your response to this post and started another thread in here about the issues starting a VM with more than 1 vGPU, can you please have a read of it and tell me what you think?So in UK your working now?? And I’m up late trying to get this thing working…after work lolRegards,\\nSSDHi SSDResponded to the other post as well :-)May be a bit of confusion …As each Application wants to see a GPU per process, I’m assuming that you would run multiple VMs, and run each Application on a dedicated VM? (up to 4 VMs with a 4Q or 4C Profile assigned to each). This would share the T4s resources across 4 individual VMs simultaneously.The alternative to that, is to assign the entire T4 to a single VM using the 16Q / 16C Profile. However, you mention above that the Application wants to see 1 GPU per process, so I’m not sure if that will work. Do these Applications all need to run at the same time as each other?Yes, working now … :-)RegardsMGI have installed the follwing VIB NVIDIA-VMware-430.99-1OEM.670.0.0.8169922.x86_64.vib on the ESXi 6.7 Host after a successful install, reboot then running the command nvidia-smi I dont see any vGPU’s listed..!HiMake sure your Host Graphics Setting is still configured for \"Shared Direct\".RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

older guest driver from the vGPU 13.x branch? Just to rule out the latest guest driver? I’m not aware of any given issues with the vGPU 14.1 driver but I didn’t test it myself yet.regards\\nSimonThank you for the reply. I have tested 13.3 both host and guest.  There is no other settings  etc you are aware of ? could try an earlier to…@sschaber  I tried 13.0 now and it made no difference… I am out of ideas. Same thing when passing through the whole GPU …Which profile did you assign during the driver installation?A40-8Q… For CAD machines.Sounds to be more related to GPOs or Windows OS. Is the VM joined to a domain?\\nHad once a case that a security setting in a GPU stopped our drivers to install properlyYes, Provisioned citrix W10 machine. Also to rula that out installed a “local” 2019 server with no domain. Same issue.Hi, another idea would to modify the TDRDelay settings to see if it installed when having more time (10sec instead of 2sec)TDR testing and debugging information for developersPerfect, I will try that next.Made no difference. Any other tip ?@sschaber  here is the daemon log on the Hypervisor :Jun  2 09:46:21 xen01 vgpu-9[13537]: notice: vmiop_log: ######## Guest NVIDIA Driver Information: ########\\nJun  2 09:46:21 xen01

       " 'tesla-p4-hp-dl385-gen10-esxi-6-5-showing-no-ram-available-on-telsa-p4': 'Hi there,   We have 3 x Tesla P4 cards we are wanting to use on ESXi 6.5 for vSGA use.   I installed the first 2 on HP DL380 Gen9 server with Intel CPU’s and installed the NVIDIA-VMware-418.196-1OEM.650.0.0.4598673.x86_64.vib file and everything is working fine with those 2 servers.  We are running ESXi V 6.5.0 build 17477841 on all 3 hosts.The issue I have is with the 3rd host which is HP DL385 with AMD CPU.  I’ve tried installing the same driver and it shows up in vCenter.  It shows the card, it shows the Active type ‘shared’ and configured type ‘shared’ but shows memory as 0.00mb.Also if I run nvidia-smi it shows it says no devices were found even though the bios and ESXi show it’s there.   So it’s obviously something to do with the drivers not loading etc but I don’t know why.I’m clearly missing something here.I’ve also tried updating the driver to the latest version I could download NVIDIA-VMware-460.73.02-1OEM.650.0.0.4598673.x86_64.vib but it hasn’t changed anything.I’m losing my mind with this one…any help is very much appreciated.Can you run nvidia-smi on the ESX host after installing the VIB? What is the output? Seems the GPU is not recognized properly. Maybe you need to check the BIOS settings first.Yes I have run it, as mentioned in my original post.  It just says ‘no devices were found’ but clearly it is seen by the bios as it’s shown in iLO, BIOS and in ESXi …That’s why I’m confused.check with dmesg on the host if there are errors, I still assume a wrong BIOS settingThere’s a whole load of stuff in there when I run that command…not sure what I should be looking for, but this stuff seems GPU related.2021-07-06T09:54:40.203Z cpu44:72073)NVRM: GPU at 0000:23:00.0 has software scheduler DISABLED with policy BEST_EFFORT.\\n2021-07-06T09:54:40.217Z cpu44:72073)NVRM: GPU 0000:23:00.0: RmInitAdapter failed! (0x26:0xffff:1290)Any idea what sort of settings in the BIOS I should be looking for  ??  I checked the IO-SRV in virtualisation section and that’s enabled.   Well it’s greyed out so I can’t select it, but it says enabled in grey.As you can see the board is not loaded properly. Might be BIOS related or hardware defect. Please check with HPE first for the right BIOS setting. Especially the MMIO settings are relevant. P4 doesn’t require SR-IOV enabled. In addition, I’m not sure if P4 is qualified for the given server at all. As far as I can see only T4 was validated.Yeah I figured out that something like that was going on, but have been through all of the setting in the BIOS and there’s nothing at all that I can see that’s related.   I just assumed if they worked fine with Gen9 of the same server that the Gen10 would be fine… I know that’s not always the case, but wouldn’t of expected it to not work like this, but wasn’t sure if I needed to get advice from HP or NVIDIA or VMWare so I’ll see what I can get from HP.Thanks for the advice.OK so annoyingly HP says it’s not supported on this server which is really dumb… and frustrating.   But at least if someone else is looking for this information it’s here now.Thanks for your help sschaberOK so I have a bit of a wrinkle in this story.   Today I removed the card from the HP DL386 Gen10 and put it into the Cisco UCS C210 M2 server we had to see if it worked there and got exactly the same issue…everything looks fine in the sense that the BIOS reports it, VMWare see’s it, but says it’s 0 Mb of RAM.nvidia-smi reports no devices available.It seems a bit to coincidental that both servers are doing the same thing…   I know I have read that some of the Tesla cards are selectable between modes but I’m not sure if the Tesla P4’s are like this and maybe the card is in the wrong mode ?   I haven’t been able to find any information about that with the P4 but just thought I’d ask the question in case I’m missing something there and I’m fighting a losing battle if the card isn’t going to respond properly.Any advice is appreciated as always.   I’ve got some other later model Cisco servers I’m going to give the card and go in to see if I get similar results.Have you tried to use ESX 6.7 instead? Why do you still use 6.5? Modeswitch is not possible on the P4 as it handles graphics and compute in parallel.\\nDid you open a support ticket with our NVES? They could analyze the nvbugreport to see if points to the issue.\\nAnd please keep the “old” 418.x driver for your testing as I doubt the latest one is working with 6.5 due to extended VIB size. You even need a current patch for 6.7 to extend the VIB size accepted and VMWare didn’t release a patch for 6.5 as far as I know.regards\\nSimonHi Simon,I used ESXi 6.5 because I understood that it was the only version that officially supported the VSGA function without some kind of licencing.   As I said, we have 2 other servers with the same card, running the same version of driver but with DL380 Gen9, not DL385 Gen10 but hard to know if it’s a card issue or something else going on as I’m not familiar enough with these cards and ESXi to diagnose.I haven’t done anything else other than post here as I wasn’t aware of any other options sorry.Thanks for the info on the modeswitch, I did assume it couldn’t, but thought maybe it was a reason the card might not seem to be working properly, but at least if we know it’s not possible then at least I know it’s not that !I am going to use another server to do some more trialing with different drivers, ESXi etc etc to see if I get any different results.  I couldn’t really do too much on our production servers, but now I have some other servers to prove if the card is or isn’t working properly.  That’s my first step I guess.Even when I installed the latest driver I had, ESXi didn’t complain and said it was installed successfully I thought, but I better read it again just to be super sure.Unfortunately you are wrong. ESX version is not relevant for licensing. You always need a vPC license for vSGA as soon as you use a GPU like P4.Thanks for letting me know that.   The licencing model is super complicated I found when I tried to look up what was needed.   Found plenty of posts in other places with very confused I.T staff also, so was obvious it wasn’t just me struggling to understand it.I found a driver for ESXi 6.5 from before NVIDIA had their vPC licencing so that’s why I assumed it didn’t need any kind of licencing for that version.  I know I needed some kind of licencing for the later versions (which I ended up needing to install to get things going on the other servers) so once we get all three going we will get whatever we need to make us legal.So I haven’t got anywhere with running the card on seperate servers or seperate O/S’s.I’m just wondering if it’s worth me attempting a bios / firmware flash to make sure it’s not something like that  ?   or is there some process so we can diagnose further ?I can find a BIOS but it’s for SUSE or some other Linux, so wondered if there’s some other easier method than going through setting all that up just to flash it again ?It’s really frustrating…Do you mean flashing the GPU? Doesn’t make any sense as this is never necessary.regards\\nSimonYes.  I mean I know it’s not normally needed, but obviously in this situation it’s not working as expected so I just thought maybe it could be something like that since it shows up in BIOS and in ESXi, but the drivers won’t initialise in ESXi or Windows…  so guess I was clutching at straws a bit.how can I diagnose further what might be happening ?Just wanted to let everyone know that might be having similar issues that this was down to a faulty card.I went through everything over and over and have had working cards in other servers with no drama’s so I knew what it should be doing.Finally after exhausting all options I contacted the supplier and got a return / replacement and it worked straight off once it showed so clearly it was some kind of fault, but it showed in BIOS etc and in VMWare partially as mentioned… but now I know it was a faulty card.Thanks for everyone that replied.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

As you will need to pay for vPC anyways, customers tend to use vGPU instead of vSGA to benefit of all the advantages as vSGA doesn’t provide all the features vGPU does.K1/K2 doesn’t require licensing at all but you won’t get current drivers for these extremely old GPUs.

       " 'how-to-update-an-existing-registered-license-server-with-a-backup-license-server': 'Hello,\\nI decided to add High availability functionality to my existing NVIDIA license server. I need to download an updated license file in order to add the new license server.\\nHow do I update an existing registered license server with a backup license server?\\nWhen trying to create a new on I get the error: \"Host ID \"xxxxxxx\" already exists (or a host with the same UUID exists).\"\\nI couldn’t find where to update an existing license server.When you add a license server to the License Management Portal, you do this as either a single license server, or as a HA pair. Due to current limitations in the License Management Portal, you cannot turn a single license server into a HA pair once it’s been added, nor can you remove it. The easiest way to resolve this is either:A: If you contact NVIDIA Support, they have the ability to remove an existing license server for you. You should then be able to re-add it as a new license server along with your new backup license server. Create the new license which will be bound to both of those new MAC addresses and download it. To stop any unexpected issues, reset your existing license server before applying the new license file to it using this link: https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4111/~/a-change-occurs-on-the-grid-licensing-server-such-as-ip-address,-or-a-change-in. Import the new license file into both of your license servers, and using a GPO, push out the new addresses onto your vGPU enabled VMs.B: Leaving your existing license server running to maintain service, build 2x new license servers in your local environment (you’ve already built 1 new one). Once built, add them to the License Management Portal as a HA pair. Remove the licenses from your existing single license server (un-map add-ons). Then create the new license which will be bound to both of those new MAC addresses. Download and import the new license file into both of your license servers, and using a GPO, push out the new addresses onto your vGPU enabled VMs. Regarding your old license server, you can either leave this unused in the License Management Portal, or contact NVIDIA Support to remove it.C: Assuming your license server runs as a VM and not a physical server … Shutdown your local license server, generate a new MAC address in your hypervisor and power it back up. Using the URL from Option A, reset your license server. In the License Management Portal, remove the licenses from your existing single license server (un-map add-ons). Then create the new license which will be bound to both of those new MAC addresses. Download and import the new license file into both of your license servers, and using a GPO, push out the new addresses onto your vGPU enabled VMs.I have not personally tried Option A, however I know that NVIDIA Support have the ability to remove a license server. If it were me, I’d go with option B, as you can run this in parallel with your existing license server until the change over happens. There won’t be any issues with VMs not being able to contact the license server if there are any delays in bringing the service back up. You can take your time and not be rushed. However, if you have other services on your existing license server that are reliant on a specific MAC address, then you may want to use options A or C.Just to add … License server management is something that’s being worked on internally at NVIDIA as we speak. Expect new management features and enhancements to be released as and when they are developed. Everyone I’ve spoken to is well aware of the current limitations and these are being worked on. So don’t worry, this will become easier as the platform evolves :-)BenNetworking is defined as the act of making contact and exchanging information with other people, groups and institutions to develop mutually beneficial relationships, or to access and share information between computers.

       " 'm10-1q-profile-not-allowing-more-than-2-displays-with-10-2-drivers': 'Hello,We recently upgraded our ESXi hosts and VMware Horizon 7.12-managed virtual desktops from vGPU software version 8.0 to version 10.2.  According to the release notes for the software, I thought that this would allow the M10-1Q profile to allow up to 4 display heads.However, when in Horizon, the \"max number of monitors\" is locked to 2.  I’ve tried creating a new pool with the snapshot, but as soon as Horizon detects that the graphics drivers is the M10-1Q profile, it still locks the max number of displays to 2.Any assistance understanding and/or fixing this would be appreciated.Thank you,JordanHi JordanWhat resolution are the 4 monitors?Out of interest, if you change to a higher vGPU profile for a test, does it work with the 4 monitors?RegardsMGThank for the reply.On further testing, I note that I can in fact do at least 3 monitors, so I guess there’s no actual issue with the amount of pixels the profile will allow displays.My issue, then, is the for non-persistent pools in VMware Horizon, in the pool settings the max number of monitors shill shows up as 2, and this is incorrect.  My understanding is that the there is no maximum number of monitors, just a maximum number of pixels, so I guess there’s no \"correct\" value to put here, but perhaps it could be indicated somewhere in the documentation that Horizon will continue to display this value.Hi JordanBack when vGPU 10.0 was released, NVIDIA switched from a \"Fixed Resolution\" to \"Pixel based Resolution\". They did this due to the large amount of non-standard panels that are becoming increasingly popular, such as the Super Ultra-Wide variants. I myself use a Dell U4919DW which has a resolution of 5120 x 1440. At first glance, the resolution looks quite high, however once you calculate the total amount of pixels, it’s not very high and is actually less than a single 4K panel. The problem is that because it’s a non-standard resolution, the previous versions of vGPU drivers wouldn’t support it, and when trying to run Virtual Machines in full screen, I’d have a full screen vertical display (1440), but with the black \"bookend\" on both ends of the screen as the vGPU driver had a maximum horizontal resolution of 4096 (and my monitor is 5120) so wouldn’t accept the resolution, even though that same version of vGPU driver would support multiple 4K monitors (up to 4) which as said, with even just 1 of those being a higher total pixel count than my U4919DW. The logical option for NVIDIA was to move to a far more flexible configuration, which is where we are today.The reason for asking how many monitors you have and the resolution of them, is that with the 1Q profiles you can support up to 17694720 pixels. A few examples of common resolution options are available here: https://docs.nvidia.com/grid/10.0/grid-vgpu-user-guide/index.html#vgpu-types-tesla-m10 so you can calculate what you’ll be able to run.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

This will help guide you towards any component that might be struggling. What you can also do as well, is have the \"Windows Resource Manager\" running (not \"Task Manager\" as that only shows the CPU as a single entity) and this will show you the utilisation of each of your CPU Cores so that you can see if it’s a single threaded limitation.Purely as an application comparison, it may be worth downloading an evaluation of the current version of AutoCAD to see if that exhibits the same performance issues. This may be a non-starter depending on whether you have a corporate defined application stack.If you can’t get anywhere with the monitoring, it would be worth speaking to VISI Tech Support to see if there’s some application tuning that can be done to improve the performance (however that would typically mean there is a hardware limitation).Regardless of the above, a 1.5GB CAD file is a big file to deal with! It may need breaking down into smaller parts, but I do realise this sometimes isn’t an option as you want to see the entire model at the same time.I’d be really interested to see the hardware metrics and what kind of load it generates on your workstation if you’re able to share.RegardsMGthank you for the reply I will get you some data…Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Our Citrix Policy is setup to use the video codec on actively changing regions on high quality. We are using NVENC for moving images within the session.At random points throughout the day, users complain about their VDI freezing for less than a second, and then resuming. It’s very obvious when they are running AV materials, because both audio and video pause and then resume like nothing happened. Sometimes this freeze will cause the audio to desync from an online video on sites such as youtube or vimeo. Typing will also be delayed, and a number of words will suddenly run across the screen. All users see the issues occur, but it’s not something that happens at the same time to everyone.Storage is an all flash array, and as far as I can tell average read and write latency are under 1ms. Network load seems low, and according to our monitoring tool, we aren’t seeing dropped packets or spikes in round trip latency on our routers.

This did not have a meaningful impact on the issue. The worst part about the problem is that I have yet to devise a method of reliably recreating the issue. I can hammer on a session with multiple videos and applications running simultaneously, and they won’t flinch. Yet other users complain that they have to watch their typing catch up with them multiple times per hour.When the issue occurs, the entire VM appears to freeze momentarily, and then resume. If anyone has any insight, I would greatly appreciate it.HiIf the entire VM freezes, then that sounds like a connectivity / networking issue to me. It doesn’t sound performance related, and your hardware specs sounds fine.4-8ms is very good, so it’s not latency related.What are the end point devices that are being used?

Citrix Receiver is 4.12, but we have been able to replicate the issue in testing on the latest Workspace 1812.Connecting to the VDI externally through our netscaler gateway doesn’t alter the situation.Well, that all sounds fine.RegardsBenYes, we’ve tried different Citrix video policies, and they all produced similar results.Typical users have two 1920x1080 monitors.We’ve tried multiple end points. We have some Mac, Linux, and PC clients in the office, and it’s universal.I’m beginning to think it might be a CPU ready time issue, but more testing is required.HiWhich CPUs are you running and what’s the over-commit ratio on them?Have you been through the BIOS settings to make sure they’re configured appropriately for your deployment and the same across all hosts? I appreciate that by checking that you may need to power cycle the Hosts, so it’s not always a quick / easy thing to check.Lastly, has this issue been there since the start of the deployment? Or has it gradually gotten worse over time / through updates or through additional user density?Sorry for all the questions, just trying to understand exactly what you’ve tried and the environment. As you can appreciate, there are many many variables within the stack that can cause issues.RegardsBenIt’s been worse since we added patches for Spectre and Meltdown to the hosts. We originally deployed these hosts with Windows 7, and eventually migrated to Windows 10. Performance degraded slightly with Windows 10, but these random pauses in the sessions didn’t start until after we deployed patches for Spectre and Meltdown.All the hosts have the CPU’s configured for the highest power profile possible, with C-States and P-States disabled. Each host has Dual Intel E5-2695 V4’s with 18 physical cores. Hyperthreading is enabled. We have about 82 vCPU’s configured on 72 logical processors. If you count the additional logical CPU’s in the calculation, we are at a 1.125:1 commit ratio. It goes up to 2.3:1 if you only count physical cores.A new wrinkle to this.Yesterday I deployed some machines to a hypervisor that is used for image updates and testing purposes, and discovered that the freezing disappears when I turn off NVENC for session encoding. Has anyone else experienced momentary pauses in their video stream in session while using the GPU to encode the stream? CPU Usage and overall utilization goes up in the session, which I’d like to avoid, but the random 1-2 second pauses have dissipated.HiThanks for the additional information.Regarding your BIOS tuning, I have a couple of articles that you may find interesting. The first one is a slightly older article that discusses Single Core vs All Core Turbo and would be applicable to your configuration. Note your Base Clock, All Core Turbo Clock vs Single Core Turbo Clock:Clock speeds on modern Intel processors are not straight-forward, a fact that is attested to by the several articles we have published on that topic in recent years. This can lead to confusion over what CPU to pick when configuring a new computer,...The second article was written a few weeks ago and discusses various BIOS settings to help engage Turbo:https://www.mycugc.org/blogs/tobias-kreidl/2019/03/07/tale-of-two-servers-bios-settings-affect-apps-gpuThe above aside, that’s an interesting discovery with NVENC. I’ve not experienced that issue before. Out of interest, have you tried monitoring the encoders directly on the GPU through nvidia-smi just to see how loaded up they are? Or, a nicer way to visualise the utilisation would be to use NGPUTOP:Yet another ncurses GPU utilization monitor inspired by htop - JeremyMain/ngputopRegardsBenHi Jake,i had a similar issue on our environment some month ago. Here it was the ctxgfx.exe which crashed some times.\\nYou can reproduce it when you kill the mentiond process.The process will start new and the screen flickers one time.

       " 'tesla-zero-power-idle': 'Apologies if this is a simple question and my Google-fu has failed me but…The docs for the Tesla K80 show that there is a “Zero-power idle” mode. In my mind that differs from being in P8 (idle) where each GPU draws in the region of 25W.  50W per card total is NOT zero, so this doesn’t seem like idle and zero-power idle are one and the same thing.The only other place that gives explicit mention of this feature (and it may not even be done at the GPU end) is IBM’s LSF documentation - specifically there is a setting LSB_GPU_POWEROFF_DURATION. The docs say that it is possible to power off a GPU when it is not in use to save power (doesn’t say if this is a whole slot or a single GPU).A cursory look through the NVML API shows some calls to read and set power states, spanning P0 to P15 (though the card seems to use P8 as the idle state), though no mention of powering off a GPU.There is the “drain” mode available in Linux via nvidia-smi but that looks to prevent new things from being run on the card - the power meter shows no change when cards are put into “drain” mode if the card was already idle to start with.Question is - how can one activate the zero-power idle feature of a Tesla card ?Many thanks,Pat.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Nvidia marketing materials seem to recommend different cards too, but I’m not sure if that’s because I can’t pull up the same info from several years ago or not.Ultimately, my question is: is the K80 card a good option for server 2D/3D acceleration of virtual machines?\\nIs there a better option (something under $400 that’ll work in a Dell 720xd server)?(I’m aware of Dell’s official stance on graphics cards in this chassis.  I can keep it cool. I’m looking for options that will work whether or not they are officially supported.)HiThe K80 is Compute only and won’t do 3D. Also, it’s an extremely old architecture. Basically, don’t bother.The easiest way for you to do it is with a Quadro (or multiple Quadros) running in Passthrough (1 Per VM).There are plenty of Quadro options available depending on your budget. Here are some from the Pascal architecture that you can search for: Page Not Found | pny.com If you want something current, then you’re looking at the Turing architecture.

       " 'xendesktop-7-6-autocad-mouse-issues': 'HiWe are running a series of POC’s for customers who use Autocad 2015.The POC hardware is a supermicro server with 2 K2’s.We have applied the policies shared by Jason (thx btw), and all Nvidia demos are working perfectly through HDX 3D pro.The VDI machines are running Windows 7 64 Bit, latest VDA hotfixes.Our issue, and showstopper, is with Autocad. What we experience is mouse lag and cursor problems. Sometimes the Windows cursor sits ontop of the acad cursor. Sometimes the cursor changes to a random Windows cursor, the problem is \"solved\" by moving the pointer out of the drawing area and then back.Autocad gives a warning at first startup regarding the hardware acceleration but sees the grafx Card and shows DirectX 11 is used.We are aware that GRID is not on the Acad 2015 hardware compatibility list.We have been experimenting with Acad 2016 to see if the problem is solved. But it is exactly the same. GRID not on the hw compatibility list here as well.If anyone has an idea to how this problem can be fixed or know someone who does, tell me! :)The cursor lag is as a result of the remoting protocols, and is compounded by the network conditions (ICA latency in particular).I’d suggest optimising the network to stabilise latency, ramping up the framerate, working with Citrix on the best way to improve this. (possible mouse timer tweaks in the registry for example.)try giving acad.exe his own core, and ctxcfg.exe another. also howmany vCPU’s does the machine have?AutoCAD can only use 1 core normally if it has to  share it with OS and ctxcfg.exe (Citrix’ compressor) it will be sluggish.HiWe are aware that GRID is not on the Acad 2015 hardware compatibility list.K260Q is on the certified listAutodesk is a global leader in design and make technology, with expertise across architecture, engineering, construction, design, manufacturing, and entertainment.jaccow makes some very valid points. Recommendation is that you should have at leas 4vCPU’s when delivering 3D workloads.oh Yes and for AutoCAD don’t forget to update the client’s drivers as well.I’ve found that a local old AMD card with a NVIDIA Grid in the XD sessions will give strange mouse issues.AutoCAD can be a server rendered cursor and you may find tweaking MouseTimer (as described here Performance Tip: Disabling Mouse Shadow for XenDesktop and XenApp | Citrix Blogs ) helpful.If the lag is down to the network I’d try to investigate why, if limited bandwidth you might find thinwire+ added by Citrix in XD 7.6 FP3 helps https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2015/10/09/a-big-leap-in-ica-protocol-innovation-for-citrix/ (see the comments below the blog from AutoCAD / CAD users on build to lossless success).If you are on high latency >70ms then it might be worth tuning the TCP/IP window as described in: CTX125027 – How to Optimize HDX Bandwidth Over High Latency Connections How to Optimize HDX Bandwidth Over High Latency ConnectionsDo let me know if anything helps and also if it doesn’t!\\nRachelThe single largest performance boost I get with acad.exe is setting CPU affinity. So pin the exe to one CPU. You’ll need to configure any shortcut the user launches the application from to do that, but the performance boost is very noticeable.Check out MouseTimer.  It’s a registry key on the client.  Makes autocad feel much more like a local program when you have a little latency between the user and the server.I had a link, but it looks like Citrix took the page down during their last restructuring; bummer – bet lots of my links are broken now.  The reg key should be:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Citrix\\\\ICA Client\\\\Engine\\\\Lockdown Profiles\\\\All Regions\\\\Lockdown\\\\Virtual Channels\\\\MouseSince the artcile is down, I’m pulling from memory – I think the default value is 100 (it’s a *, but it translates to 100).  It’s a measurement in MS, so every 100ms all mouse actions will be collected and sent to the server.Drop this guy down to 30-40 ms, maybe a little more, and see if that makes a difference.  I have no idea how much of an impact it will be fore you, but it will generate more bandwidth…Hi Virge,Mousetimer default is 10, what you are doing is actually raising it - I wrote an explanation here: Performance Tip: Disabling Mouse Shadow for XenDesktop and XenApp | Citrix BlogsYou may also find this useful: Configuring Virtualised Autodesk and similar applications including XenApp GPU-sharing and tools for sanity checking DirectX/OpenGL usage | Citrix BlogsAutoCAD is very CPU heavy relative to GPU so often the CPU GHz is important.Best wishes,\\nRachelRachel,the whole legacy graphics vs DCR vs H264 vs codecs vs whatever else seems to be floating around is another one of the intricacies that just escapes me.Windows 7 - Which one do you like with AutoCAD\\nWindows 10 - Which one do you like with AutoCADWindows 7 - Which one do you like with Revit, SpaceGAss and Inventor\\nWindows 10 - Which one do you like with Revit, SpaceGAss and InventorSo many conflicting opinions… and do i want to use DCR ?And which compression do you like with XenDesktop 7.11 ?Many thanks.Lastly - is the new \"Relative Mouse\" setting on the receiver an advantage ?Scratch that - the relative mouse is no good for AutoCAD.Hi,we run serveral proof of concepts with main usecase autocad 2019/2020 with highly intensive, detailed files and drawings.I have seen multiple topics in front of Autocad Performance in Citrix Virtual Desktops, including this one, where some of you have suggested to use cpu affinity for better Performance (for autocad or ctxcfg.exe)Is it still necessary in 2020?

You also can send me some private message, for sure.Thanks in advance.JensHiSounds like you’ve done everything correctly, and as you don’t have any big issues it’s difficult to make any recommendations for changes.But if I were going to make any changes, I’d start with your CPUs. Server CPUs are always a compromise between Cores vs Clock Speed because of the requirement for User Density. A 3.2Ghz CPU today is considered low-end to average by physical Workstation standards that are designed to cater for your workload, because for your workload you would trade Cores for increased Clock Speed and 4.0Ghz or above would be standard for AutoCAD in a physical Workstation, but for a Server where you need those Cores to support additional Users 3.2GHz is a really good place to start.You mention you’ve run several POCs, so I’m assuming you’re not in Production. With that in mind, Intel launched some updated CPU models that are a better choice than those you are currently running.Xeon Gold 6256 - 12 Cores @ 3.6GHzIntel® Xeon® Gold 6256 Processor (33M Cache, 3.60 GHz) quick reference with specifications, features, and technologies.Xeon Gold 6246R - 16 Cores @ 3.4GHzIntel® Xeon® Gold 6246R Processor (35.75M Cache, 3.40 GHz) quick reference with specifications, features, and technologies.As for CPU affinity, I’ve never had to do this.What resolution are your monitors and how many do your users have?During the \"rendering and highly intensive tasks\", which component becomes the bottleneck?RegardsMGThanks for your answer. The CPU Infos confirm my thoughts and expactations, thanks for that. Perhaps this could be some addtional performance.-> Rendering is CPU related, the software takes in this case 100% with all cores, we have switched today from 4 vCPU to 8, now its agreable and okay to use and similar to local workstations.In the configuration which i have posted, we have  round about 28 Users (80+ in summary) per Server, and 7 VMs per GPU.All users have 2 monitors, most of them 1920x1200.Most usecases are smooth and better than on the old fat clients which are outdated.-> Only issues are AutoCAD related, with some lagging or bad user experience while doing certain workflows. In summary this specific users usecases are a little bit a question mark for the proof of conecpt.CPU, RAM and GPU-RAM are not too busy in this cases and there is no significant usage visible, end user latency and network is also not a topic.These are very complex drawings with a high number of objects. Users are making changes, adding lines, lots of copy paste stuff, lots of zooming in and out in the workflows. Then there are some lags, sometimes mouse performance is not the best as in comparison to other files or other programs.-> Things which i have in mind to try are disabling some autocad advanced features/options, playing a little bit with the NVIDIA graphic profile/system settings (performance/quality or a individual setting instead of the default which is \"Let the 3D Application decide\") or installing AutoCAD 2020 instead of 2019.Do you ever have had the need of customzing/tuning AutoCAD by itself or choosing individual NVIDIA Settings?HiThanks for the details.Increasing the CPUs Clock Speed would give you more performance, especially with more complicated models, and 3.2 to 3.6GHz should give a noticeable improvement.Something else that’s worth validating … When you have time outside of business hours (or during business hours if you have an empty server with the same Specification), try running the same workload but with only 1 user connected to the Server and see if there’s a performance or experience difference. The reason being that your CPUs now have a 4.5x overcommit on them, assuming all 28 users are running 8 vCPUs and there is nothing else running on the Servers, whereas previously is was closer to 2.3x. This would tell you whether you’d be better going for more Cores or increased Clock Speed. For example, with the 3.4GHz 16 Core CPUs mentioned previously, you’d get a slightly faster Clock, and reduce the overcommit to 3.5x if everything else stayed the same. It’s always worth knowing at what point your hardware’s performance starts to deteriorate, and if 2 or 3 people start rendering at the same time or with overlaps on the same Host, you could end up with peaky performance which is really frustrating, this is more likely to happen with increased vCPUs, so it’s worth keeping an eye on, especially if drawings start to become more complex.On the platforms I design, deliver and support, I always make sure they’re kept well up to date and are running the latest versions of Software and Operating Systems. vGPU drivers are always kept up to date as well. The Applications get treated a little differently, as moving to newer Applications can initially reduce productivity if there are significant differences between that and the previous version. It’s easy for me to just say run the latest Applications, when I’m not the person that will actually be using them. However, the recommendation to my customers is always try and run the latest versions of whichever Applications you use to take advantage of the latest features, performance and functionality. However, the users may (and probably will) need some time to adapt before any real performance metrics can be gathered. So to directly answer your question, if the users are happy to do so, then I would be running AutoCAD 2020 over 2019.For the NVIDIA Control Panel, I typically let the users decide what they want to tweak inside there. This is always going to be Application specific as to any benefits and as AutoCAD is typically CPU limited, modifying the NVIDIA Control Panel doesn’t always give much benefit in my experience. There are some basic settings inside AutoCAD that can make things run more smoothly, and there are plenty of random guides on the internet of things to try that relate to the entire Operating System. For example, have you run the Citrix or VMware Optimiser tools?If you’re not locked into those server specifications and this is still a POC, I think the biggest gain you’re going to see will be CPU related by going for a different model. If these are your production servers, then you’re effectively trying to turn things off to improve existing performance, so system wide optimisations are key, which is why I mention the Optimisation Tools.RegardsMGBasically we are caring very much about a clean and optimized image, so i would say that this is also on a good level.We are going now as result of the PoC with the 3.4GHz 16 Core CPU, and also for the productive environment there will be AutoCAD 2020 too, surely with all the latest drivers and updates. As you mentioned, first because of the \"more\" need of overcommitment, and also for a benefit with a litte bit more CPU clock speed.

It has been qualified onto the VMware Compatibility Guide, but this was performed with the NVIDIA A100, A40 and A30 GPUs. To make sure you receive complete support from VMware for the server in case of any issue, they are suggesting to use one of those GPUs (Qty. 2) in your configuration instead of the NVIDIA RTX A6000s.The server with VMware does provide support for vGPU and DirectPath I/O functionality.\"Though I’m familiar with the A6000, I am not with familiar at all with the A40.My company needed the A6000 to provide multiple VM’s with at least 8 GB of vGPU memory (for 4K and 8K rendering). I’m worried however that moving to the A40 could be a problem, as the A40 seems more like a compute/CUDA card.Another problem with the A40 is that it:If anyone could help, I would greatly appreciate it (as my company is having me build a virtualized system, and I know very little about virtualized systems, let alone vGPU systems).I greatly appreciate any help anyone could provide.Thank you,\\nNelsonHi Nelson,In general you could use A6000 or A40. Both GPUs have the same GA102 chip on it. If you want to use virtualization with Horizon, why do you think the display ports are relevant? No matter if you use A6000 or A40, both GPUs need to be in DC mode to support vGPU which also means that the GPUs run in headless mode.\\nNow the main difference: A40 is a DC board and the default mode is already capable to run vGPU. A6000 instead is a workstation GPU and therefore needs to be modified to run vGPU at all (mode selector tool).\\nFor a performance perspective, the A6000 has a slightly increased memory clock which results in maybe 5% better performance compared to A40 on specific use cases.\\nHaving a passive cooling is not a disadvantage for server systems. Actively cooled boards quite often cause air flow irritations in servers and therefore the best option here should always be to run passive cooled GPUs.So the recommendation in your use case would be to use the A40 to have a fully supported stack.Best regards\\nSimonPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

I would like to clarify, do I really need vGPU software and vDWS or vCS license to just Passthrough the Tesla P100 card to one VM for computational purposes? Is it depend on the hypervisor vendor?Thanks in advanceHiIf you want to use vGPU (licensed under these versions: vApps, vPC, QvDWS, Virtual Compute Server), then yes, you need a license and you need a specific version of the software which is only available from the Licensing Portal.If you want to use Passthrough, and only intend to use it for Computational workloads (without graphical acceleration, because there won’t be any as it’s the wrong type of driver) then you don’t need a license, and you can download this driver from the normal NVIDIA Drivers site.RegardsMGThank you for your reply!\\nBut now I am curious, if direct GPU Passthrough does not need vGPU Software (and license), why vGPU take 1 VirtualComputeServer license per GPU in Passthrough mode? Is there some advanteges of using Passthrough with vGPU Software over Passthrough without vGPU (I meen in respect to computational workload, because for graphics mode you have explained the difference)?If you want to use multi-vGPU or a fraction of a GPU then you are good to go with vGPU instead of Passthrough. In addition, as soon as you run vGPU you are eligable for support. Passthrough instead (with default Tesla driver) doesn’t include support.regards\\nSimonHivGPU allows you to share the GPUs resources between multiple concurrent VMs so you can run multiple workloads simultaneously. For example, instead of running the entire GPU inside 1 VM and doing nothing else until it’s finished its task, you could run 2 concurrent VM workloads with an 8C Profile, or 4 concurrent VM workloads with a 4C Profile etc etc. It really depends how intensive your workloads are as to how you share the GPUs resources. Also, as Simon mentions, you also get the benefits of NVIDIA support as well as having a much more flexible platform.RegardsMGThank you all for your responses!\\nI will consider different benefits that brings Virtual GPU Software.

It seems like there has been a recent renewed interest in these cards due to the silicon shortage, but in all of the posts/videos about them the cooling is kind of an afterthought. There are a number of people on ebay selling coolers, but in many cases they didn’t fit my requirements. I needed a design that was compact enough to support having two k80’s (with coolers) installed in adjacent PCIe slots. I’ve been using this design for a number of months now, with two cards being used to train stylegan2 networks and haven’t run into thermal throttling issues. I figured I’d publish the designs to solicit feedback and potentially make things more usable for others and unblock aftermarket users of these cards.The design is based around 40mm fans controlled via a feedback loop with a Raspberry Pi Pico. Temperature is measured with a thermistor bolted to the outside of the GPU using the bolt pattern on the heat spreader. There’s an algorithm that tries to optimize fan speed to balance noise and cooling power.The github org is here, PRs are welcome. There’s also a blog post here that goes over the design rationale.(This is my first post on this board so apologies if it’s in the wrong location)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

But I don’t know how to do it. Can anyone help me with this problem?HiYou’ve purchased a Consumer grade GPU which is not capable of being virtualised. What you’re asking for cannot be done on that GPU.In order to do what you’re asking, to provide the best choice in GPUs, you’ll need a \"rack mount\" server chassis. This will enable you use a Tesla V100, Quadro RTX 6000 / RTX 8000 or Tesla T4, all of which can be virtualised. Previous generation Pascal architectures are also available such as the Tesla P100 or Tesla P40. Earlier versions that support virtualisation would be Maxwell (M60) however this is unsuitable for your workload.The V100, T4, P100 and P40  are Passively cooled, meaning that you can’t run them in a typical \"tower\" workstation chassis as they do not have fans. The RTX 6000 / 8000 are Actively cooled (they do have fans), so you could run them in either a tower workstation or rack mount server.Whether you use a tower workstation or rack mount server, you’ll need a Hypervisor (VMware is best) along with its Enterprise Plus licensing (to allow GPU virtualisation) and the vGPU software from NVIDIA with Quadro vDWS licensing for each VM to enable you to share the GPU. You could use a cheaper Hypervisor such as XenServer or KVM, but you’ll lose features, functionality and usability. Basically, you get what you pay for …For future reference, here’s how NVIDIA list their product lines:GeForce - Consumer\\nTitan - Prosumer\\nQuadro - Professional\\nTesla - DatacenterNeither the Consumer or Prosumer lines support virtualisation. Out of Quadro, only the RTX 6000 / 8000 support virtualisation. All Tesla support virtualisation.Honestly, it’ll be cheaper and easier for you to buy another identical workstation with 2080Ti and run them independently.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

It seems to me that you are saying that you are not being able to do PCI-passthrough using the A100? Is that it? Could you please elaborate?No, we have managed to do PCI-passthough of A100 with our openstack platform. In nova configuration at the compute and api nodes, which is the case for any PCI card, you have to enable the PCI-passthrough in filter_scheduler and whitelist the card and define the pci alias. You have to enable IOMMU at the kernel and at the bios in order to allow the PCI address translation between the host and the guest. In contrast to the previous cards, like P100 and V100, where you do not have to specify device_type in their configurations.  In these legacy cards, device_type takes the value “type-PCI” by default. In case of A100 as it is sr-iov enabled device, you have to specify either “type-PF”  or “type-VF”. Otherwise, the card will be registered as type_PCI and then the nova scheduler will not find any valid hosts to select in the aggregate. Please take a look into the following links:https://mohamede.com/2019/02/07/pci-passthrough-type-pf-type-vf-and-type-pci/https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/pci-passthrough.htmlIt is interesting that you say that. The T4 cards are also SR-IOV enabled devices (as far as I can tell from the product brief, page 4, table 3) and yet we did not have to change the device-type to neither “type-PF” nor “type-VF” for these cards to work properly in PCI-passthrough mode. I will definitely be paying attention to this when our A100s arrive though, thanks for sharing.You are welcome. Good luck with your A100 configuration. Please keep us updated if you manage to assign MIG slices or assign the whole card to the VM without specifying the card type. It could be related to Nova version.Sure I will update with our progress :)Hi,I’m also looking to expose MIG slices (card A30) to Openstack instances, @Antonio_Paulo, did you have any success? Timesliced is working just fine with mdevs but it looks like our use cases would benefit from MIG slicing@ETP1 NVIDIA still hasn’t delivered the A100s so we didn’t have the opportunity to try itHi, any update on this?Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

There is no way to separate GPU Users from Non-GPU Users on the same Host.Just so you’re aware, both of the use cases you’ve listed are GPU accelerated. Also, the GPU does more than just application acceleration, and it cannot be separated out by controlling which applications users have access to.RegardsMGThanks for the info MG! I guess we’ll just add an extra RDS for the office users then.Perhaps I can also ask a question on license requirements? We are going to use this server for interns that are part of an education program. We want to have about 16 users on the server max. Can we go for perpetual EDU licenses, or are there restrictions on how to use the EDU ones?HiPerpetual EDU Licenses are fine, make sure you also purchase SUMs as well though, that way you’re entitled to Support and Software upgrades.Regarding your license choice, for the Students using Revit, you may want to look at the QvDWS license depending on what they’re doing with the software, as the Quadro driver has a lot of optimisations in it for Professional software that the vApps / vPC driver does not.RegardsMGHi, we are planning to redo this setup, this time with a different approach. For this test we have 2 servers at our disposal, both HPE DL380 with 48 cores (@ 2.5Ghz) and 768Gb RAM each. One has two Tesla T4 boards, the other has one M10 board.The plan is to setup the first server as RDSH offering high end 3D apps like Revit Full and Lumion. We expect around 16 concurrent users accessing this environment.The second server will host around 42 users on RDSH that are only using Office apps and occasionally startup a Revit Lite app to do simple (mostly 2D) work.My question is, would this work with the hardware listed and what licensing would be required? My guess is the 42 lite users could do with Grid vApps right? Together with 16 QvDws licenses on the heavy server?Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

What in that case?\\nWill it be enough with one M10 per server?\\nWhat license do we need?\\nAre there any other GPU that will serve us better?All inputs are welcome.Thanks!HiYour choice in hardware would be ok (although I’d replace the M10s with T4s) if you were using virtualisation, but as you’ve said you want to use bare-metal then it’s not appropriate. I can’t actually remember the last bare-metal install I did, it would have been over 10 years ago though. Just out of interest, why don’t you want to use virtualisation? You’ve already picked out appropriate hardware for it? …The simplest, most cost effective solution would be to use the hardware you have selected, deploy a Hypervisor on each of the ML350s and run an RDSH VM on each of the GPUs on the M10 (4 VMs per ML350). That will easily handle 50 users per ML350 no problem at all, with capacity for a few more if needed. However, what I would do, is the same design, but as the M10 is pretty old now, I’d replace 1 M10 with 2 T4s. Depending on your Hypervisor choice, you could then either allocate an entire T4 to each RDSH VM having 2 RDSH VMs per ML350, or use vGPU to split each T4 in half to create 4 VMs and run 2 of them per T4 totalling 4 VMs. Virtualisation with T4s is my recommendation.Now let’s look at what happens when you run bare-metal … Firstly, your RDSH use case and hardware selection is going to be problematic. Multi-GPU with RDSH is a bad configuration and should be avoided as much as possible due to the nature of the workload and how RDSH uses the GPU. Your RDSH Server will not share the workload over 2 or more GPUs if that’s what you were hoping for. Despite the M10 having 4 8GB GPUs totalling 32GB, your RDSH Server will use only 1 of them, meaning that the system will only have 8GB of usable framebuffer to cater for your 50 users (not to mention encoding and processing). Basically, you’re going to run out of GPU resources before you get anywhere near your 50 user total. To be clear, certain applications can use Multi-GPU configurations, but they are not suited for RDSH deployments.Problem 1 with bare-metal, is that your RDSH Server will only make use of 1 GPU, so you’re going to need a bigger GPU, but that said, I’m not sure I’d want to put 50 users on any currently available single GPU, I’ve never even heard of any one doing that, I think it would be cost prohibitive.Problem 2 with bare-metal, is because of the user count you’re going to need something powerful (and expensive). Meaning that because you can’t use the correct low-end hardware you have to use high-end hardware for a lower-end use case to support your user density. I could suggest something like a Quadro P5000 or RTX 5000, but I’m not sure 16GB would be enough for 50 users. Realistically, you’re going to be looking at something with 24GB or more, so something like a P6000, P40, RTX 6000 or above. (It just gets silly for this type of use case).You could purchase 2 extra ML350s, downgrade the spec of each of them and aim for 25 users per RDSH and then you could opt for a 16GB GPU (you wouldn’t use a smaller GPU in this configuration because you’d have no flexibility). Again, the reason you’d do this, is because as you’re running bare-metal, the OS will only use 1 GPU so you need more Hosts.You already have the correct hardware for it (albeit with a GPU change to a pair of T4s) so unless there’s a solid justification for not using virtualisation, in my opinion you either need to scale out and purchase more ML350s or scale up with a larger single GPU and risk not over loading its resources.RegardsMGThank you for that wonderful answer. :)\\nSpot on what I needed to hear.I am open for a ESXi-solution.How about this configuration?\\n2 x HP ML 350 Gen 10.\\nDual CPU.\\n>150 GB RAM.Installed with VMware Essentials Plus (latest version).\\nvCenter on a seperate machine.One Virtual RDSH (Windows Server 2019) per ESXi-host (to start with).\\nOne \"Tesla T4 - 16 GB GDDR6 - PCIe 3.0 x16\" per host (to start with).Is that configuration ok?Or maybe it is enough with just one \"HP ML 350 Gen 10\" and boost up the RAM and add more T4 and install 3-4 virtual Server 2019?\\nCould that handle up to 90 RDSH-users?What license do I need for the T4-card?Sorry for a total newbie in this area.But I think I’m getting what you are writing.Each M10 (board) has 4 GPU á 8 GB.\\nEach virtual RDSH can handle one GPU (8 GB).\\nTherefore I must install four virtual RDSH on each Host to fully be able to use all the four GPU.Or I could use a T4 that could be used by one single virtual RDHS.\\nOr install two T4 on one Host and then install two virtual RDHS.My options are:\\n1.\\nOne ESXi-host.\\nOne M10 on that host.\\nFour virtual RDSH (each get one GPU á 8 GB).One ESXi-host.\\nTwo T4 on that host.\\nTwo or four virtual RDSH (If four the use vGPU to split the T4).Do you think one Host can manage 90 users?As I said, we are not using Autocad or any high end applikation.\\nBut we are opening a lot of drawings through various applikations.\\nWe are using Office 365, webbrowsing, a lot of drawings in PDF, DWG TrueViewer, BlueBeam Revu and some more smaller apps.Still my question about license remains.We use published Remote Desktop App through RDWEB only.i would really appreciate if you (or someone else) could give me some more answers.HiGreat, virtualisation is back on the table! That makes things much easier!Yes, the M10 has 4 8GB GPUs, and because you’re running RDSH you would use 1 of those for each RDSH VM, totalling 4 VMs. Depending on the resource requirements of your Apps and how your users use the system, each 8GB RDSH VM would support approximately 20 - 25 concurrent users. This is an industry average, your mileage will vary + / - which is why you should definitely run a POC before making any firm design decisions.VMware (vSphere) is top of the line, but it’s not cheap. For vGPU, you’ll need vSphere Enterprise Plus. This is why it’s important to understand the difference between Passthrough and vGPU and also understand your workload and how it will use the resources. If you were to use the M10, because of your workload and the fact the M10 is a Multi-GPU board, you’ll be assigning an 8GB GPU; does it matter if that GPU is Passthrough or vGPU? The answer is, it depends on the amount of flexibility and features you want from the system. If you just want to provide access to a GPU enabled RDSH VM and don’t need any additional features, then you can get away with Passthrough and Essentials licensing with the M10. If you were to use the T4 you would have to assign the whole T4 (due to not having VMware Enterprise Plus licensing), making them 16GB RDSH VMs, but you would need fewer of them to support your density. Does that make sense?For any VMware deployment, you really should be using vCenter. Without it, administering your vSphere Hosts becomes really limited. For vGPU however, it’s a prerequisite, but if you’re only using Passthrough, then you can get away without it, but it’s not something I’d ever recommend.Regarding your ML350 specs, which CPUs are you looking at using?To get started for your POC, you’d be looking at something like this for each RDSH VM with an M10 running in either Passthrough or vGPU:8 vCPU\\n32GB RAM\\n8GB GPU\\nSSD / All Flash StorageThat’s 128GB RAM total, leaving the rest for the Hypervisor, and you’ll be able to run 4 of those per ML350.If you were to go down the T4 in Passthrough route, then you’d be looking at a scaled up version of the above with something like this:12 vCPUs\\n48GB RAM\\n16GB GPU\\nSSD / All Flash StorageIn theory, you should need less of them as they’ll support a higher user density, and you’d tailor the vCPUs and RAM based on the POC results. If you were to use vGPU with the T4, then you’d be looking at the same specs as with the M10 but the T4 running as 8GB and supporting 2 VMs.Those specs are not definitive, and the final specs will be based on your POC results.If your ML350 is spec’d highly enough it will manage the 90 users (and above) without issue. But remember you should be providing N+1. If anything fails, you’ll impact a large percentage of users.Licenisng:Depending on your final configuration, you’ll need a combination of the following:vCenter Standard\\nvSphere Essentials / Enterprise Plus\\nWindows Server Standard\\nRDS CALs\\nvGPU vAppsIf you’re running Passthrough and have no intention of ever wanting vGPU, you can look at other Quadro GPUs and not pay any vGPU licensing. Because we’re now using virtualisation, we can have multiple GPUs in the same physical host (whereas with bare-metal, we can’t). You can now look at multiple Quadro P4000 or Quadro RTX4000 as these are single slot 8GB GPUs. You can run these in Passthrough and there is no NVIDIA licensing, however, these are still a bit much for just RDSH workloads, but you wouldn’t use anything smaller.If you wanted to use the M10 or T4, you would be looking at vApps licensing (regardless of Passthrough or vGPU). With the exception of vCompute, all other vGPU licensing is per Concurrent User, so you’ll need 100 vApps licenses.I hope that helps.Overall, and despite all the configurable options, my recommendation remains the same as my first post. Don’t try and skimp on features and functionality if you can afford them. Use the T4s running 8A vGPU Profiles.RegardsMGHello,I am reading this information, because I try to find out the best efford.\\nCuurectly we have a customer with about 50 users on a RDSH server.

Microsofts Discrete Device Assignment (DDA) is not the way to do it?“DC driver = TCC only”What is “DC Driver”?I have found the that “TCC Only” is “Tesla Compute Cluster Only”:Additional resources for NVIDIA Nsight VSE.Which states: “Current drivers require a GRID license to enable WDDM on Tesla devices.”Does NVENC work in TCC Mode or does NVENC count as a part of “Graphics”?Found this:If the software specifically supports NVENC in TCC mode, then it could work?How to enable Windows Server VM to run the TCC mode? Simply follow through with Microsoft DDA?Thanks!\\nAtmapuriHi Atmapuri,DC driver = datacenter driver :)DDA is the way to go with Hyper-V. DDA is supported with the vGPU driver.The NVIDIA vGPU software product support matrix.I never used NVENC in TCC mode (with DC driver) but I would assume that this should work. If it works you could use it without a vGPU license. If it doesn’t work you would need to use the vGPU driver (and a vWS license).\\nBTW: It doesn’t matter if Hyper-V is not supporting vGPU. You would also need the license to use DDA (Passthrough) or even baremetal. The driver makes the difference not the virtualization technology…Hope it is clear now.regards\\nSimonDear Simon,Thanks a lot for this info. This does add a few stones in to the mosaic. Still missing few pieces though:DC driver = datacenter driver :)1.) Ok, Then the DC drivers are downloadable from here:Download the latest official NVIDIA driversWhere it says: “Data Center/Tesla” in the dropdown box.And this is also what I have installed for now in to the host, just to check that Tesla is present and working.2.) In our case NVENC is to be used by a Windows Service and it should be running also while there is no user logged in or connected to the Windows VM via Remote Desktop or other desktop access software.There a number of articles on internet (10+ years old), which say that NVidia TCC solves this problem, but there is nothing about the NVidia vGPU driver.Additionally, in case of vGPU:\\nWhich license would we need for this? You mention vAps and vWS, but vCS looks closer to me?\\nWhich license covers NVENC and allows capability described above?BTW: It doesn’t matter if Hyper-V is not supporting vGPU.3.) If I go here:Deliver Graphics Acceleration to Virtualization.and try to register for a trial version of vGPU software, it is not possible to specify Hyper-V. And the Hypervisor field is marked as “required”. How to get the driver?Our machine is certified for vGPU (ProLiant DL380 Gen10) although we will only be using one card within one VM with it:Download NVIDIA GRID datasheets, guides, solution overviews, white papers, and success stories. Watch GRID videos, webinars, and webcasts.After pretending to use the VMware Sphere, I got to see this:\\nNvidiaCapture1904×1086 155 KB\\nAnd the questions would be:\\na.) Is the Nvidia Microsoft Hyper-V 2016 Software to be installed in to the Host or in to the Guest?\\nb.) Is there any support from Nvidia Installer to Configure Microsoft DDA?Thanks!\\nAtmapuriPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Any reason rebooting vmware RHEL VMs would start breaking nvidia-docker apps? Or how to fix ‘CUDA-capable devices are busy or unavailable’ + ‘gridd: failed to initialize RM client’ when nvidia-smi works and other VMs are able to use the GPU?Background:We had our hypervisor (vmware) + 2 guests RHELs (Q or C splitting GPU mem in half) + nvidia-docker CUDA app running fine on both. Namely, nvidia-smi running fine in the hypervisor/guest docker, Nvidia RAPIDS cuda context creation / compute / etc in docker.At some point, one of the GPU VMs was rebooted and the docker images failed to start.  Nvidia-smi did not work, yet it was fine in the hypervisor and the other VM, and licensing seemed fine in the other VM. We reinstalled the guest’s original gpu driver, restarted docker, and created the docker images, which immediately fixed nvidia-smi in the guest + docker… but then we saw “all CUDA-capable devices are busy or unavailable” errors whenever the docker app (RAPIDS) tried actually using the GPU.  In addition, checking gridd logs showed error “failed to initialize RM client”. The GPU reported itself to be in Default mode (shared), and reinstalling the nvidia-docker runtime did not help.More fun: We then took the second VM, that had been continuously working all along, and restarted it… and nvidia-smi broke at the guest level too.Hi Leo8,Thanks for posting.  I recommend that you open a support ticket so our support team can dig into the issue.thanks\\nDHappy to, any idea where?

Initial i’ve setup an environment with multiple vSphere 6.7 hosts and NVIDIA grid drivers version 10.0. Now i want to update these hosts to a newer version because we have trouble with the graphic performance (black screens and driver crash in the guests). My first try was to update within the major version to 10.2. I put one host in maintenance and install the new host driver VIB. Check with nvidia-smi -> all fine. After them i used one VM to test the guest driver. Driver update failed. I uninstall the old driver, reboot the vm and install the new driver -> installation failed. I run this as administrator and i stopped the virus protection. After them i tried to update to version 11.0. My host is fine but the guest driver installation failed. I checked the same thing with two other VM’s -> same result.\\nIf i deployed a new vm (same OS, drivers and so on) then the driver installation works. But i have around 100 exsisting VM’s - they could have all the same failure. I checked the filesystem with sfc /scannow and used dism to control that Windows isn’t damage. No hidden devices or something else. It’s very frustating.The installer logs show’s an error:I contacded the nvidia support but with different time zones it’s very long between any answers. Has anyone an idea what i can check?Let’s start with the basics.  How are you updating the driver?  Gui?  CMDline?  If command line what commands are you using to do the install? And on the windows 10 side, what OS release are you using, have you confirmed it’s supported by 10/11?If the above all looks good I’d try installing just the driver and seeing how it works.  Currently I do the below for our driver installs and it seems to workHi garyd,thanks for your reply. My goal is to update these drivers through CMDline. But since it failed i tried GUI installer too. My parameters are nearly the same as yours (without -passive and the packages).\\nMy Windows 10 version (ver. 1803) are supported with driver version 10.X and 11.0.Now i tried your one. Extract the installer, run setup with your parameters and then reboot the vm. After reboot i could not see NVIDIA control panel and the device manager shows only a \"Microsoft Basic Display Manager\" instead of the NVIDIA Grid Display.That’s super odd.  I’d try to confirm that any Nvidia settings/folders/Registry items haven’t been left on the machine that could be blocking the install.Would also try installing with just the Display.Driver package to see if that can work.  Might make it easier to parse the logs to see if something seems off.  I don’t have any a t4 so i can’t help by doing a more thorough test here.\\nIf no luck I’d definitely try to get a support ticket open, there may be a know issue that can fix this.Hi derhoeppi I know it’s been years but did you ever find a solution?

We have had it setup for several months now and it seemed to have been working fine however, we recently noticed some of our VM’s exhibiting performance issues.  We tracked down the issue to the VM’s vWS license somehow getting dropped/lost.  We can reboot the VM and will re-acquire the license but my understanding is that all license server clients that have acquired a license would attempt to renew when the lease reaches 15% of it’s life span.  It does not appear to be doing this consistently.  Just over the weekend, we rebooted all our VM’s - we have 55 of them.  We then confirmed that the DLS pool has provisioned all 55 licenses.  This morning, we came in that it appears that the DLS server is only reporting 12 licenses being “in use”.  Why did the the other 43 did not renew?  BTW, we have 70 vWS licenses so we have definitely covered our current operational needs.

Is it even possible to have users with different amounts of available GPU power?What current technologies are there in terms of GPU sharing within VMware Horizon (vDGA etc.), which card(s) would work best for above scenario and which licenses would we need?I have found the following sources, but it is still quite unclear:NVIDIA GPU accelerators provide IT departments the graphics and compute virtualization resources needed to meet demands and scale across the enterprise.\\nA100, L40, L4, A30 and A16 seem to be worth looking into.and the buy-grid/ guide, which I can’t link because new users can only provide one single link per post…\\nThe licensing model doesn’t make much sense without any context as to when which license is required. vPC, vWS, vPC and vApps. Or perhaps the licensing model when installing on-prem GPU cards is totally different?\\nIt’s all just a big blur right now.Thanks for any clarification.Hi ST84,Thanks for the question.What current technologies are there in terms of GPU sharing within VMware Horizon (vDGA etc.), which card(s) would work best for above scenario and which licenses would we need?vGPU is NVIDIA’s technology for GPU sharing for virtual desktops.  vGPU is a licensed software and is licensed based on CCU.  For virtual desktops L4, L40, A16 or A40 would be the current options.  The “L” and “A” refer to different generations of GPU - “L” for ada Lovelace being the latest technology.For GPU sharing for compute tasks like HPC, AI, Deep Learning, the A100 and A30 can also be used but require a different licensing scheme called NV AI Enterprise.  I don’t think you are looking for this.Of those users about 100 need basic GPU performance and about 50 need a higher amount of GPU performance.vPC is our license/technology for basic GPU acceleration aimed at Knowledge workers i.e. users who are using Windows 10 OS and basic productivity is improved with GPU acceleration.  vPC can provide a better quality of experience to these users.  A16 is the most commonly used GPU for vPC installations.vWS is our license/technology for users who are running 3D graphics accelerated applications - i.e. anything ranging from AutoCad to more complex 3D applications like Maya.  This lengthy guide provides information on how to size a system sizing-guide-nvidia-rtx-virtual-workstation.pdf, although our basic advice is to ask what GPU do your users use now for these applications and then relate the physical GPU to vGPU profile proxy.   The GPU choice will depend on your user needs but vWS is supported on A16/L4 and L40.  A16 would be considered an entry level GPU.Assuming your definition of basic and higher amount of graphics usage matches ours you would be looking at 100 vPC licenses and 50 vWS licenses.To get started I recommend that you work with an NVIDIA partner who is familiar with vmware, NVDIAI vGPU and the various OEM server vendors who offer NVIDIA Certified Systems.   You can locate a partner here: Find an NVIDIA Partner | NVIDIA  Search via compentancy “NVIDIA Virtual Desktops”.A partner will be able to guide you through the various GPU options, density, server considerations, ESXi versions etc.-D-Hi DougT,what I’m trying to wrap my head around is:\\nExample;\\nWe install two A40 cards in our hosts, what difference, other than the dollar amount, does it make if we now buy x-amount of vPC licenses or x-amount of vWS licenses? I guess what I’m trying to ask is, are the cards software-throttled based on what licenses we activate?Thanks!For GPU sharing for compute tasks like HPC, AI, Deep Learning, the A100 and A30 can also be used but require a different licensing scheme called NV AI Enterprise.Sorry to interject, but does this mean that the software required for sharing GPU compute resources remotely on the A100 is effectively unavailable to non-business customers?\\nFor example, if I wanted to provide some friends with remote access to my A100 when they would like to experiment with some AI things, I would be unable to do so with the device I purchased for personal use?\\nIs it even possible for an individual to subscribe to AI Enterprise if they are not doing so through a business account, even if they were to pay whatever the price might be?\\nDoes NVIDIA provide access to the features of products in any other manner when the features of a product otherwise require AI Enterprise?

I had to install windows server 2019 with Hyper-V and configured it with Discrete Device Assignment (DDA) because, from what I read until now, there is yet no way for hyper-v to distribute the GPU across all VMs. But, I also read that a microsoft solution might be underway soon.Today I came across Nvidia vGPU. Supposedly, Quadro vDWS should be the software to install (the server hardware is fully supported), but does it still require Hyper-V with DDA? If so, does this mean I can only have 4 VMs using the 4 GPUs available? If that’s the case, I don’t understand the purpose of using Quadro vDWS. My goal is  is to make the 4 GPUs available to all existing VMs.\\nThanks and regards\\nDavidHiThe problem is Hyper-V, not Windows, NVIDIA, the V100s or vDWS.If you switch Hypervisor to one that supports vGPU, you’ll have far more functionality available. XenServer, vSphere, KVM, AHV, they all work with vGPU. Hyper-V is the one that doesn’t. You’ll need to use DDA (Passthrough) if you want to carry on down that road, and yes, that will limit you to 4 VMs, 1 per GPU, as you can’t virtualise them (with Hyper-V).As for vDWS, that’s part of a 4 tier licensing model. vApps, vPC, vCS, vDWS. Each version allows different functionality, with vDWS being at the top.Out of interest, what was your planned use case?RegardsMGThanks for the reply. So if I understand it correctly, even if we buy the vDWS package it won’t be possible to make the 4 GPUs available for all VMs? But if so, I can’t see any advantage of using it with Hyper-V and still it is available for purchase?!On the \"NVIDIA VIRTUAL GPU PACKAGING, PRICING AND LICENSING\" document I read yesterday (from June 2019) Hyper-V is supported and the recommend license is Quadro vDWS.Although I was not consulted for que acquisition, this server is supposed to be used at a University for department for research.\\nThanks and regards.\\nDavidHiAt the moment, the only option with Hyper-V is to allocate an entire GPU to 1 VM, or multiple GPUs to 1 VM. As there is no vGPU, there is no ability to run multiple VMs on a single GPU.Whether used in DDA (Passthrough) or vGPU, Tesla GPUs require a license depending on the use case and required functionality. With Graphical sessions, the licensing is per concurrent user. With Virtua lCompute Server, the licensing is per GPU. Have a look here for license functionality: Client Licensing User Guide :: NVIDIA Virtual GPU Software DocumentationAs you’re using Hyper-V, your options are limited to either allocating 1 V100 to 1 VM and having a total of 4 active VMs with 1 user on each. Multiple V100s to a single VM, or, you can use a VM with the RDSH role installed and a V100 attached and provide multi-user access like that to achieve greater density. Changing the Hypervisor will give you vGPU functionality.How many VMs do you have that require GPU access?RegardsMGThank you so much for the reply. For now we are using 3 VMs, but I guess it won’t be long to all 4 have their respective assigned GPU.In the link you providedTable 2.

Anyway, no one considered any licensing, so I guess users will have to use Hyper-V with DDA and none of the vDWS or Virtual Computer Server. GRID Virtual Applications seems the only one to be available for free.\\nIf I got it right anyway…HiYes, QvDWS is the premium level license. This license covers everything the GPUs are capable of delivering, from performance to features and functionality. There is no higher level license.DDA / Passthrough will still require a license. Have a look at the table on Page 12 of your link above for guidance on specific use cases. You can either use vApps or QvDWS depending on your requirements. QvDWS will allow CUDA workloads and Quadro features, whereas vApps is for RDSH and more basic applications.Most expensive scenario, assuming 1 VM per GPU, you’ll need 4 QvDWS licenses, but we’re not talking about a lot of money in the big scheme of things. That said, in your post above you mention the workloads will be run at a University, therefore I assume you work in EDU, if that’s true, then you could be entitled to an EDU discount for any licenses, so check with your license provider before purchasing :-)RegardsMGHi.\\nThanks again. yes I read about education licences.\\nThe weird thing is that I have already at 2 people working with 2 linux VMs using the assigned GPU, and everything seems to be working fine. No one told me otherwise.

Anyone building a new environment should be looking at T4 or RTX 6000 / 8000 GPUs, or a mix of them depending on the environment. These will be more cost effective, more flexible and provide much better performance. Although they will technically work in a new environment, Maxwell and Pascal architectures should now be used for existing environments where those specific architectures / GPUs have already been deployed and consistency is required for scaling up / out (although there’s an argument against doing that as well), and Volta is altogether a different use case.It sounds like you’re quite new to this type of technology. You should be planning to do this already, but I would strongly advise you run a POC with the customer and also get yourself a private test Lab so you can experience and familiarise yourself with these technologies before discussing them with customers first, it will make things a lot easier for you :-)RegardsMGThanks for your reply MrGRID!so, just to clarify… costumer doesn’t have Citrix Virtual Apps at this moment, so, I’ll propose a new lab with this technology and nvidia to them.Thank you so much to advance.HiBefore you design the POC environment, you need to gather some details and metrics from their existing physical workstations. You should have the specifications of the physical workstations (CPU, RAM, GPU, Storage), the resolution of the monitors and how many monitors are going to be used, a full list of all applications, and also some newly captured performance and utilisation metrics from these applications. That’s an absolute minimum. After you have those details, you can begin configuring the appropriate hardware specifications for the POC. At that point, you can also find out whether they are experiencing any performance limitations, you can then add performance where it’s needed into the POC specifications.As you’ve already mentioned AutoCAD and Image Processing, your CPU choice should have a fast base clock (3.0GHz +). Forget about Turbo, you’ll have a better, more consistent experience with a fast base clock. Depending on the application requirements (how it scales it’s performance) and how many users you plan to have on each Server, you may want to use a pair of these:Intel® Xeon® Gold 6254 Processor (24.75M Cache, 3.10 GHz) quick reference with specifications, features, and technologies.A 12 Core variant of the 3.1GHz CPU is available. Also, there’s a 3.3GHz 12 Core variant as well. Which version you go for will depend on how the applications perform, but your minimum base clock should be 3.0GHz.For the Image Processing, pay close attention to which components are used (whether it’s CPU (single threaded or multi threaded (if multi threaded, how many Cores can it make use of))) or does it use the GPU. If it uses the GPU, how much framebuffer and processing are used. If it’s heavy, you may want to look at an RTX 6000 / 8000 over a T4.As a heads up, currently, the latest vGPU release (vGPU 10) doesn’t support the latest XenServer release (XenServer 8.1). So when you’re ready to build the POC, make sure you check the current supported versions and if needed install XenServer 8.0. That will allow you to run  XenDesktop 1912, Windows 10 1909, and vGPU 10. You can then simply upgrade XenServer to 8.1 once it’s supported.RegardsMGHiJust to add … NVIDIA have now added support for XenServer 8.1 and vGPU 10, so you can ignore the last paragraph above.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'esxi-6-7-u2-tesla-m10-cannot-use-all-available-gpu-ressources': 'Hi Guys.I have 3 Dell PowerEdge 740 servers with 2x Tesla M10 in each server. All hosts are running ESXi 6.7 U2 with \"NVIDIA-VMware_ESXi_6.7_Host_Driver\" vib in version 430.27-1OEM.670.0.0.8169922.Graphics type for all hosts is set to \"Shared Direct\".In general the GPUs and vGPUs are recognized by the guest operating system (Win Server 2016/2019) and can be used.But apparently there are 2 problems which have the same effect.With 3 hosts, 2x M10 in each host, I should be able to deploy 12 VMs with \"M10-8A\" profile. Right? Or 24 VMs with \"M10-4A\" profile, for example.But at the moment I only have the following vGPU assignments in the cluster:\\n3x M10-8A\\n1x M10-4A\\n3x M10-2AAnd I cannot start another VM with a \"M10-4A\" vGPU profile…If I look at the GPUs and which VMs are running on them, then I see that all GPUs except 1 have 0 bytes memory and all VMs on this host are running on the same GPU.The other 2 hosts show all available memory (8x 8 GB), but only 2 VMs are running on these hosts, each VM on a vGPU.I’m completely confused why I can’t start more virtual machines with vGPUs in this cluster.Maybe someone has an idea.Thank you all.HiIf you’re using the \"A\" profile with M10s, the only profile you should be running is 8A. Because of the type of use case recommended for the \"A\" profile, it makes no sense to run a smaller profile.What’s probably happened in your environment, is your vCenter vGPU setting is set for \"Performance\" instead of \"Density\" and it’s spread the VMs across your M10s so you can’t start another VM. Either allocate all your vGPU profiles to 8A or change the vCenter setting to \"Density\" and see if that helps.RegardsMGHi MrGRIDThank you very much for the prompt reply.I changed the \"Shared passthrough GPU assignment policy\" for each host from \"Spread VMs\" (performance) to \"Group VMs\" (consolidation). And at the moment it looks good. I will test it further.And I will also think about changing all profiles to 8A.Thanks again. :-)Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

In the documentation, is explained how to run multiple vGPU, in a single VM with an A16 GPU with q and c series. We made some test attaching from 2 to 10 vGPUs to a single VM and it works fine. But when the VM is shutdown, sometime we show in dmesg the following messages.\\ndmesg_vgpu.txt (16.8 KB)After this failure, if we try to run another VM the server comes stuck and the only thing that we can do is to reset it physically.When this occurs, the vGPU process in the server does not end. I had a walkthrough, so I didn’t need to reset the server, killing the vGPU process and reseting the GPU with nvidia-smi -r. This brings some problems, if im running another VM with a vGPU we need to stop it while it is working, so it has to start from the beginning. This makes the server not production ready, because we need to shut down VMs in production, and we shouldn’t stop production VMs.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

You would need at least 4 RDSH VMs per host to leverage the Tesla M10 (4GPUs in Passthrough each).\\nFor your scenario you will need 150 vApps licenses if these 150 Users connect concurrently. Otherwise you will need the number of CCU.Hope this helps.Regards\\nSimonSimon,Correct, I would just leverage a single GPU per VM Guest RDSH which my hope is that would be much better than using the standard built in VMWare Graphics adapter and take some of the load off other resources.\\nIs this reasoning correct?\\nThe reason for putting a single RDSH on each server is for redundancy (I won’t go into the whole enviroment and how it is setup). There is currently about 35 other servers spread across the deployment.We probably over purchased with the Tesla M10 considering our environment but I basically asked our provider to put a video card that could be leveraged for a RDS Guest in esx that was fully supported in this configuration and that is what was provided.Since it is on 3 different esx host and we have up to 150 user connect concurrently would the vApps cover all 3 NVIDIA M10 cards on the machines?HiJust so we understand this correctly, as you have \"about 35 other servers spread across the deployment\", your intention is to give your users a better graphical experience (on 3 RDSH VMs) and you’ll use these 3 RDSH VMs to add resilience in your entire deployment. You intend to try and support all 150 concurrent users using (only) 3 RDSH VMs? …Apologies in advance, but that does need some clarity, because (as Simon mentions above) 3 RDSH VMs with an 8GB GPU will not support 150 concurrent users.I would just leverage a single GPU per VM Guest RDSH which my hope is that would be much better than using the standard built in VMWare Graphics adapter and take some of the load off other resources.\\nIs this reasoning correct?YesWe probably over purchased with the Tesla M10 considering our environment but I basically asked our provider to put a video card that could be leveraged for a RDS Guest in esx that was fully supported in this configuration and that is what was provided.We can look in to this when you’ve confirmed the first question at the top :-)Since it is on 3 different esx host and we have up to 150 user connect concurrently would the vApps cover all 3 NVIDIA M10 cards on the machines?The NVIDIA License Server sits centrally to the deployment. All RDSH VMs will need to be able to contact the NVIDIA License Server. By doing so, all user sessions will be licensed correctly. Again, you mention 150 concurrent users, 3 RDSH VMs will not be able to support this.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'maximising-performance-using-up-to-date-drivers-and-basic-system-tuning': 'As this is the \"Benchmarking Section\" of the forum (and I don’t have a Blog), I thought I’d post some helpful hints here on how to add a little extra performance to your systems that some of you may not be using or may simply not be aware of.So, you don’t get much in this world for free these days. So with this in mind, I wanted to demonstrate the \"Free\" performance benefits of firstly keeping your drivers up to date and secondly using the tuning options that are built-in to the Nvidia drivers to release a little extra application performance. Now I’m not about to break any tuning records here, so don’t get overly excited, and there’s no “magic tuning” option that will get you unprecedented levels of additional performance. The fact still remains that once you’ve bought your hardware, your options for increasing its performance are limited, so you want to make sure you get the most out of it. But there are a few ways to increase performance in a couple of areas, and it’s free and it’s there, so why not use it.Drivers -Attached are 2 screenshots (\"369.09 Drivers\" & \"369.49 Drivers\") I’ve taken from the same system showing the results of a basic benchmark run with the same settings before and after a driver upgrade (Yes, I like Redway at the moment because it’s quick an easy :-) https://gridforums.nvidia.com/default/topic/991/grid-vgpu-benchmarks/benchmark-competition-redway-turbine-just-for-fun-/ ). Bear in mind this is only a slight revision to the drivers, .09 > .49, it’s not a major release, so the increase in performance may be subtle and other applications may respond differently. Also, if you were upgrading from older drivers to current ones, rather than just a minor upgrade, you may get more of a notable performance boost. When running the benchmark to evaluate any performance differences, you’ll want to do it a few times to ensure the changes are positive. With mine, as you’ll see, some of the numbers are slightly less, but the total score at the bottom is higher. When I ran this a few times, those numbers for each area would always change very slightly, but the total score would always be higher with the newer driver.Obviously, the “369.09 Drivers” benchmark was run before the upgrade to the “369.49 Drivers”.Tuning -Attached are another 2 images (\"369.09 Drivers - Tuned\" & \"369.49 Drivers - Tuned\"), but this time I’ve used the built-in tuning options within the driver. These images are tuned before and tuned after the driver upgrade.To access these Tuning Options in a Windows Desktop OS, simply “Right Click” on the desktop and choose “NVIDIA Control Panel”. Here you are presented with lots of options, some of these will vary depending on your GPU. Select “Manage 3D Settings” on the left and you are presented with a variety of 3D Settings to modify. For less experienced users, to take some of guess work out of it, some of the more common application vendors have built-in profiles you can try (see the attached “NVIDIA Control Panel”). For more experienced users, you can manually configure settings and create your own profiles by either modifying the Base Profile or you can select your application manually and create a profile for it under the “Program Settings” tab.To access these Tuning Options in a Windows Server OS, you need to connect locally using something like TightVNC. If you can’t see the “NVIDIA Control Panel” when “Right Clicking” on the desktop, then you need to change the way you are connecting. The 3D Settings you change within the Server OS, apply to all users connected to the Server.What’s interesting is that even the (slightly) older drivers when tuned, can outperform the newer drivers when un-tuned. Although as said earlier, this is not a major release, and you would need to see what Nvidia has updated within the driver to understand any performance differences, but you can see the difference with a strait upgrade between un-tuned versions.When you compare the older, un-tuned drivers screenshot (369.09 Drivers) to the upgraded and tuned drivers screenshot (369.49 Drivers - Tuned), that’s not a bad little performance boost, especially as it’s free, and I dare say that further Profile tuning could unlock a little more, as all I’ve used is the built-in profile for that application for demonstration purposes.A little extra tuning outside of the NVIDIA Control Panel that some people seem to leave alone, is the Windows Power Management options. Don’t forget to set these to High Performance, then also go through and modify the settings to suit. After this, you’re on to tuning scripts / GPOs and customization’s which are outside of the scope of this post.For more advanced users, don’t forget to tune the system BIOS (and Hypervisor if you’re using one) accordingly, as nearly all hardware will ship in Balanced / Economy Mode, not High Performance.

Its the usual UKNOWN_FAULT_FATAL - No GPU capable host available for provisioning with grid profile grid_m10-1b error.The VMs themselves won’t initialise the display driver and are falling back to the default Windows SVGA drivers. The hosts themselves won’t even run the nvidia-smi command (Failed to initialize NVML: Unknown Error).Both drivers are from the latest release - NVIDIA-GRID-vSphere-6.7-460.32.04-460.32.03-461.33.zip and are therefore at parity (one would assume!).Any ideas what I can do. We’re running Dell R740 servers with 4 x Tesla M10 cards in each.I now only have a single host left with all our VDI’s running on it!CheersCan anyone else out there who is using 12.0 or 12.1 drivers in vSphere confirm they are working for them. I have tried for 3 days now to get this working without any success. I have removed the VIBs rebooted, re-added the VIBS via the zip package with esxcli software vib install -d and just the vib itself with esxcli software vib install -v. DMESG shows no issues whatsoever as if the driver has loaded and vmkload_mod -l | grep nvidia confirms the driver is loaded…I have confirmed SR-IOV setting is enabled in the BIOS and IOMMU settings as well. Previous drivers work fine. Just not 12.0 or 12.1 which is a pain as we need Windows 10 20H2 support.Interestingly when the new drivers are loaded vSphere shows the memory available on the cards as 0.00B.HiIt sounds like the issue is with the VM side, not with Hypervisor side. Have you tried building a clean VM, install the new vGPU driver and Horizon agent with Direct Connect (save you creating a Pool on the Connection Server) and seeing if that works?What vGPU profile are you using on your VMs?I’m running 12.0 and 12.1 on multiple environments, but I’m running 7.0 U1C and 7.0 U2 so it’s not a fair comparison, but in those environments there are no issues.RegardsMGHi MG,Thanks for your input. Unfortunately as I described as soon as the VIBs are installed on the ESXI instances the ‘Graphics’ section under the host configuration in vSphere shows the GPU’s with 0.00B memory and the nvidia-smi command reports (Failed to initialize NVML: Unknown Error). Therefore the issue is likely with the drivers themselves and ESXi 6.7.0 (16713306).RegardsTomSorry its grid_m10-1b profile.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " '3d-printing-from-the-cloud': 'Hey everyone,We all know regular printing from the cloud. It’s just what you do when you hit the print button inside a VM, connected to a network printer. Now we can add the 3rd dimension to this type of workflow.Many of you CADers out there will already be using GRID-accelerated VDI sessions for your Solidworks or Autocad work. You’re already experiencing best-in-class DirectX or OpenGL CAD performance in a remote environment.…but how do you take the next step when you’re produce a physical prototype? You could download your model, and take it to the workshop. But what if you had a way to go directly from CAD-model-in-the-cloud to real-life object? Then you wouldn’t have to lug around huge (and possibly sensitive) CAD files, and versioning wouldn’t be an issue since you are always operating on the most up-to-date copy.With the help of GRID-accelerated VDI and a 3D printer, now you can.Today I conducted an experiment at the University of Melbourne’s 3D printing studio, and am very happy to report that it was a big success. I managed to hooked up an UP! Plus 2 printer to a VDI session running inside VMware Horizon View. My session was streamed to a Wyse P25 zero client end point.Here’s what I did.After plugging in the 3D printer’s USB cable into the zero client device, it immediately registered inside the VM. However, I needed to manually point Windows driver update to the location where Drivers folder inside where the manufacturer’s software had installed. Installation of the driver after that point was quick and pain-free.\\nOnce done, the 3D printing software running inside the VM communicated perfectly with the 3D printer via the local USB connection.Inside my GRID-accelerated session everything was buttery smooth. Even loading up big models presented little challenge to the remote experience when I rotated and scaled within the software. Of course, if I needed any changes made, I could jump straight into Solidworks which I already had open in the background (in the same VDI session).Looking at the setup I was really quite amazed. If you trace the wires, it goes:Here was a 3D printer moving and interacting with the real world—building a physical object—being sent commands directly from the cloud. If I had a wireless setup, the printer would have been controlled out of thin air!With the power of CUDA running on GRID in the cloud, I could see this replacing bulky, power-hungry processing units on robots and other autonomous devices that need to make split-second decisions based on real-world inputs on the fly.I’ll report back as I conduct further experiments.\\nPlease don’t hesitate to reach out to me via email or social media if you are interested in this area.Cheers,\\nMikeExternal MediaExternal Mediaso nice.Thank you for sharing, I was struggling a bit with getting my models to print from the cloud. This post I still found be helpful even though it is pretty old. I am newer to 3D printing and found this Tool box page to be pretty helpful for knowing what options there are out there for 3D printing when just starting out.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'grid-vgpu-enabled-desktops-will-not-power-up-on-esxi-6-5-host': 'I’ll try not to make this long winded. On yesterday I reinstalled esxi 6.0 (dell r730 customized ver) on one of our GRID (m10/m60) enabled servers to see how it behaved with our new vsphere 6.5 server appliance. I found that after reinstalling the software, patching the server, and attempting to start a m10 or m60 enabled vm on it, the vm would move to one of the other grid servers in the cluster to power on. My first thought was to check the graphics and found that the active type for the graphics on the \"fresh install\" server was set to basic and the configured type was shared. On the 2 functioning servers in the cluster, the active type was shared and blank for the configured type. I also found that the xorg service would not remain started for more than a couple of seconds before stopping. There is no error when powering on a desktop (my guess was that this was because the vm moved itself to another server in the cluster).I needed to interact with the graphics in an attempt to change the active type and hopefully get the xorg service to start, so I upgraded the host to esxi 6.5. That allowed me to interact with the graphics and change them to shared/ shared direct, but not for the active type is still basic. Also, the xorg service will not stay on and stops itself as soon as I refresh the screen.The vms still jump off the server when powered on like it’s the plague. I have compared every other setting and it matches up. The biggest propblem is that the xorg won’t stay running. If I run nvidia-smi from the functioning servers, I get nvidia-smi: not found. But I get information from the other servers. I’m not really sure what to look at next as there are no graphic related errors appearing, but I feel like there is a checkbox somewhere or a setting that I am missing. Any help would greatly appreciated.Just another note. When I run esxcli hardware pci list –c 0x0300 –m 0xf on a working host, the module has nvidia listed, but on the host with the issue, the module is none.I got the command from this kb VMware Knowledge Base. It says it’s for 5.0, but I figured that it might mean something.Okay. Now I’m almost certain that it’s the vib. When I run esxcli software vib list from the working server, I can see the nvidia vgpu esxi host driver. I’m going to install it on the fresh server and see what happens.EDIT: Okay. That removed the basic active type and got the xorg service started. I rebooted, but the desktops I start on the server still jump to another one.Well, using the forum search would probably help. It’s not the VIB, it’s a bug with ESX6.0 U3 as I suspect from your description with xorg…\\nhttps://gridforums.nvidia.com/default/topic/1207/nvidia-virtual-gpu-drivers/vmware-esxi-6-0-update-3-support/RegardsSimonThanks for the reply. I saw that post and ran the gauntlet on that issue last year, but I am on 6.5 now and xorg service is now started and holds. I could try that process again, but it would seem that I wouldn’t need it if the service is not having an issue anymore, correct?Edit: I think I’m 99% of the way there. I turned off DRS on the cluster and the vms didn’t move off of the fresh install host. So, I’m guessing that there is something that needs to be tweeked in DRS.I came across the same problem today. Updated NVIDIA host drivers to GRID 12.2 (460.73) and active state stays on (Basic).

       " 'nvidia-m60-m10-licensing-vms-question': 'Hi Folks,We are currently working on a project to allow 6-8+ users to access a server remotely with GPU based virtual machines in an educational setting, I’ve looked at several solutions and am leaning towards the M60 in a DELL R740 server running Hyper-V as the hypervisor.I have limited understanding when it comes to the licensing side of this and my virtualisation experience is mostly on home labs with hyper-v and back in the day when Vsphere was just esx. So firstly I’ll ask if I’m correct in the way I understand it so far.Is it as simple as that? are there any costs I’ve not considered? as this is an educational project in conjunction with a UK university via an epic mega grant are there any educational licensing models?The ideal setup would be 8 VM’s with GPU resources that can be accessed by kids to run virtual workshops with, I have tried amazon appstream and even virtualised EC2 GPU instances but the cost is prohibitive long term. My personal thoughts are Nvidia is the way to go but I need to understand the licensing costs and options before pulling the trigger on a server and card. without going in to too much detail I have aspergers and irlens so masses of text and jumping backwards and forwards through pages is incredibly disorienting and I’ve tried and given up several times.So, one server, one Vgpu card, 8 virtual machines (or virtualised apps). best way to go?regardsJasonHi JasonIf you’re just getting started with vGPU my personal advice … Don’t use Hyper-V unless you have absolutely no other choice. It doesn’t support vGPU, so you’ll be looking at using VMs with the entire GPU passed through (DDA) to a single VM (think RDSH use case, unless you plan to give each user an entire GPU). Purely based on vGPU functionality, it is the least suitable Hypervisor for this technology at the moment.Regarding physical GPU choice as you’re yet to purchase and are just getting started (assuming you choose a different Hypervisor) stay away from the Maxwell architecture (M6, M10, M60) now as the architecture is pretty old. Unless you want to use Quadro features, those GPUs will work (there’s very limited Quadro support on Maxwell), but in my personal opinion it’s not worth testing with them due to the overall differences they have compared to the newer architectures. The oldest architecture you should be looking at is Pascal. You could opt for a single P40, but that would be overkill, so the alternative would be 2x P4. These are 8GB GPUs and you could run 4x VMs on each GPU with 2GB of Framebuffer. However, even Pascal is starting to show it’s age now in various areas, and for what you’re looking to do, I’d recommend you choose something from the current Turing architecture. With that in mind, my recommendation would be a single T4 running \"vPC\" licensing. As the T4 is a 16GB GPU, that will give you 8x VMs each with 2GB of Framebuffer.Alternatively, if you did want to run RDSH, you could do this and use the entire GPU in a single VM with multiple students all sharing the same VM concurrently, that would also open up the option to using Hyper-V again as well. That licensing model would then change to \"vApps\" and you’d use the 16A profile. You would be able to support a lot more than 8x students through this model, but you’re then into a RDSH vs VDI play, and that choice is up to you depending on the workload and how you want to manage it. There are reasons why you’d use one model over the other.When you buy your server, you can configure it with a GPU before ordering. This will give you a single vendor for support issues and also make sure you install the required \"GPU Enablement Kit\" (typically low profile CPU heat-syncs, cables etc) that are required when running GPUs. Don’t forget to configure the server so that you can add additional GPUs into it later, meaning make sure you have plenty of resources installed at time of purchase as this is the cheapest way to do it rather than retro fit additional RAM or swap out CPUs etc at a later date when you want more density.Regarding discount licensing for EDU, yes this is absolutely available. Speak to your IT Partner and they’ll be able to get you sorted out. If they’re not an NVIDIA Partner, you can have a look here to find one: Find an NVIDIA Partner | NVIDIARegarding connectivity, which Protocol were you planning to use to connect to the VMs? RDP won’t work, and basically Citrix, VMware, Teradici, Mechdyne are the most commonly used and all perform very well. They all have EDU pricing options as well.RegardsMGPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Sadly, this doesn’t seem to be able to be done with consumer grade cards, so I’m looking at purchasing an older and affordable Quadro card for my home lab so I can learn this exciting technology.My concern is that I’ve learned that we’re required to download a special .vib driver to import into ESXi, however from my initial research it appears that these drivers seem licensed behind some enterprise login portal. Is this accurate?I was considering purchasing a Quadro 6000 or even a Quadro M4000 card off eBay. If I purchased one of these second-hand, am I able to get an ESXi 6.x driver for evaluation (academic) purposes? Would someone in my situation be better suited purchasing a different card? My limit is around $250.I would greatly appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction regarding this. I have a lot of consumer CUDA devices laying around, however I don’t think they can work in a vGPU environment because the .vib’s are designed explicitly for the professional grade cards.Thank you very much for reading my post! Have a wonderful day!You are right with the exception of the old K1/K2 cards. There is a public driver available and you might also get one of these boards pretty cheap. With Quadro you could only test Passthrough but not vGPU. So I would recommend to check the boards mentioned above although they still might beyond your budget.\\nFor Quadro in Passthrough you won’t need a specific driver, so no need to have the vGPU Enterprise Account.RegardsSimonDo I understand correctly that the only cards with a working public driver for utilizing vGPU sharing (one physical GPU shared among multiple ESXi VMs) are the following?NVIDIA GRID K1 (lower end GPU, 16GB RAM, less expensive)\\nNVIDIA GRID K2 (higher end GPU, 8GB RAM, more expensive)So, a used NVIDIA GRID K1 card is probably the cheapest card that will utilize this technology?Thanks for your response!Correct. For newer boards the licensing is required and you need a portal access for downloading the drivers. For sure you can request a trial account.nvidia.com/gridevalregardsSimonIs there any updated info on this? That grid eval link is dead.

I could replicate the screen freeze on initial Blast Extreme connection and subsequent reconnects with the 7.1 (412.16) and 7.2 (412.31) versions of the vGPU driver and Horizon 7.8 Agent (on both Windows 10 2016 LTSC and 2019 LTSC).Nvidia has provided a workaround that appears to work.\\nCreate the following registry setting on the master image:\\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\services\\\\nvlddmkm]\\n\"NVFBCEnable\"=dword:00000001Based on Nvidia’s very detailed response to me (which I appreciate), it sounds like without this registry setting, the vGPU driver on first Horizon session thinks it’s not installed properly and does a reload which causes the screen to freeze… At which time a reboot of Windows is required to finish the driver reload… But in the case of my non-persistent instant clones, the VM is deleted when the user logs out so every connection is a first session. In my case, once I created the above registry setting on my master image, I no longer experienced the screen freeze on initial connection or the black screen on subsequent reconnects.Hopefully this is helpful to someone else.\\nThanks,\\nJustinI can confirm this is still and issue, but the registry entry vdiguywi suggested works in the following environment:Windows 10 1903 64-bit\\nHorizon Agent 7.9\\nNVIDIA driver version 431.02Worked for me, M10, Windows 10 1903, Horizon 9.

       " 'mouse-performance-in-citrix-blast-virtual-desktops-running-vgpu': 'Hi,This isn’t a specific question about GRID performance but thought it may have cropped up given the use of 4K panels and Q profiles running GRID.  We use predominantly P6-XX profiles, but the mouse behaviour remains consistently slow at higher res.  I’ve also posted a similar question elsewhere (VMware forum, Citrix, etc.)I’ve been working with Horizon virtualisation for a while now and over the past few months more and more clients we work with are looking into 4K panels.  I notice that using mid-range resolutions such as 1920x1200 and even 2560x1600 we see a fairly performant desktop, certainly with regard to mouse responsiveness.  However, upping resolution to 4K, the mouse performance degrades.  The responsiveness is the problem, where you feel you are dragging the mouse/window rather than pushing it.  I can’t measure the lag, but the instant response is not there.  This occurs irrespective of protocol (HDX, PCoIP, Blast) and is linked to higher resolutions.  We see this with vGPU accelerated and standard desktops - there is no load on the CPU host-side, and the network bandwidth is practically idle - it just appears to be a general lag.  Endpoints are a mix of Intel NUC, PCoIP Tera 2 zero clients, Windows 10 laptops, HP/Zotac/Dell thin clients.It makes sense that there is more pixels to cross for the same mouse/hand movement with 4K compared to UHD, but I having looked at the mouse options, such as increasing the speed of the cursor, this doesn’t translate when moving window, etc.I’ve also tried this on a 30Hz and 60Hz panel with the same results.  Does anyone else feel this or have any options that could improve the feel?ThanksHello,Have you tried with VMware Tools 10.3.10 ?

Basically my topic is to use cloud technology to play one specific game and this game can only be played through cloud gaming. I’m also interested to know why no one is doing it yet.\\nI chose the Oracle infrastructure and its instance based on NVIDIA A10 Tensor Core. And then I faced the issue of virtualization.  As far as I understood, this is the process of splitting GPUs into virtual GPUs. But I did not find any information about the maximum number of virtual GPUs. In Oracle, the NVIDIA A10 Tensor Core has 24 GB of GPU Memory. Does this mean that I can create 24 vGPUs on one instance and thus have 24 clients for the game? I feel like I’m making a mistake somewhere. Is there something I should know? Maybe you have some thoughts on my topic.RegardsSerhiiHi,the topic is pretty complicated. You cannot simply choose a cloud instance with GPU and use vGPU.

After months of suffering from an occasional bug where people’s Citrix sessions seem to freeze I have been able to deduce the cause down to something related to the gpu acceleration. If I for instance edit one of the Vmware VDA machines and remove the gpu this problem does not happen at all anymore on that server. It also only happens when the user uses his Citrix Xenapp session in “Maximized” mode. The combination of these 2 factors seem to trigger it.Also interesting to note is that whenever the screen at the end user laptop or pc seems to freeze (like a glass screen you see a frozen picture of the current/latest screenrefresh) there is in reality no problem on the backend VDA server. The session never froze there or showed any hickup or error. As such a simple confirmed workaround is disconnect+reconnect to the session.So in summary this mystery feels like the Citrix is trying to switch codec or something similar in order to activate gpu acceleration and freezed at that point.ps: of course I have opened a Citrix case as well but I thought I would work both fronts as people here might have this problem too or recognise it.Hi,Can you give some more details about the versions you are using?Citrix VDA,\\nHypervisor,\\nGrid software.Can you also look at your Citrix policies that you enable GPU and also within your Windows RDS policy that you enable GPU.

Sounds like a Citrix issue or are you running at a resource limit (CPU load or FB exhaust)?regards\\nSimonHiWe are using 1912 LTSR CU2And i don‘t think it is a resource issue.It happens when only one session is connected to the server, just logged in to the desktop and doing nothing (CPU and GPU load is at 0-2%)I have further investigated this issue and it’s getting weird:The session isn’t realy freezing, it is just extremly (!) slow.\\nThe clock in the taskbar of the session is running, but for 1 minute to run it takes about 10 to 20 minutes in realtime.\\nIf i right-click the taskbar it takes minutes (!) to open the menu.Disconnect and reconnect to the same session helps, but just for a few minutes and the problem reappears…Dic,sorry but it sounds like your issue is nothing like the one I’m experiencing. You see in my issue nothing freezes on the server side nor becomes slow. In fact everything works fine on the server side whenever the end user experiences the “glass screen” effect so whatever it is is confined to the front end GUI experience so that sounds like a Citrix workspace app issue although it’s clearly dependent on the presence of a Nvidia vGPU adapter in the server side VDA.I get it upon new logons but also reconnects to existing sessions but the issue only happens for sessions in maximized mode, never in fullscreen mode.I was able to capture the and trace the issue both on client and server side.

Is it even possible with the trial access?I thought, signing up for the 90 days trial will give me access to all the software and drivers I need which will also provide a needed documentation to setup up everything.\\nFirst problem (maybe just for my understanding) there is no explicit option for \"compute server\", just nutanix, redhat kvm, linux kvm, vsphere and citrix, which are virtualization products.\\nSo does the vCS only work with virtualization? Then my question would be, what’s the difference between grid and vCS. I know, i can also have a graphic output for grid but I am not limited to it and can compute also.\\nI thought, I maybe can use a vGPU for docker or cuda applications like tensorflow-gpu, etc.?\\nI already installed the license server and uploaded a license file for Quadro-Virtual-DWS, which includes vCS, as far as i know.By the way, what is the difference between Linux KVM and RedHat KVM?\\nIn the official documents is the only supported KVM method RedHat KVM.\\nBut there are two different download products.I also just give it a \"try and error\" run and installed the linux-kvm stuff on centos and gentoo.\\n(I don’t have a RedHat installed and didn’t plan to use it. (again))\\nBoth of them give me this error \"error: failed to send vGPU configuration info to RM: 6\"\\nWhat is RM? RedHat Manager? Does it only work with RedHat?\\nOr is there a way to fix this?Maybe someone can shed light on my problems?Background:\\nI’m working on a project to make our lecture (university) python/tensorflow, etc. online usable.\\nAt the moment we have some RTX 8000, RTX 6000 and some more are included in our ordering pipeline.\\nSo I already have some cards to test with and it’s more or less a ground base for upcoming purchase decisions.Big thanks in advance and Greetings\\nMatthiasPS:\\nOn my wishlist would be a generic (linux) vgpu driver, which provides the host with vgpu devices which can be used by any application as long as the driver can get an active license from the license server. Don’t know if it is applicable with the linux kernel. But I guess technically it is.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

       " 'vgpu-for-autocad-rdsh-questions': 'Hello Gurus,We have taken on a new client who has experienced considerable growth in the past 2 years. There are offices in multiple locations across the country (3 offices, approximately 30 employees total, for now) each office is connected with high-end Cisco/Meraki VPN gear.We are wanting to go \"server-less\" at the remote offices by way of thin-clients and having a single (or potentially dual, for redundancy) robust servers at the head office running Server 2019 and RDSH for the \"typical\" employees. They also have 3 engineers who need to use AutoCAD.I am not familiar with Nvidia products, but I have done quite a lot of reading on your forums. In theory, I should be able to use something like an M10 (quad GPU?) and allocate 1 core each to 4 virtual machines, correct?In this scenario, I would deploy a Windows Server 2019 RDSH VM - this would serve ~20 CCU’s, a few of these users need the capability to open, say, Google Earth. Google Earth does NOT respond well in a terminal server environment with no graphics hardware. Hence the possible solution of using 1 of the 4 gpu’s on the M10.And then, in addition, I would also like to deploy 3x Windows 10 Pro VM’s, and install AutoCAD on them, for the engineers, and then assign the 3 remaining gpu’s to each of these VM’s. Should this work?And then what about future growth? Let’s say a year from now they have 6-8 engineers needing to utilize AutoCAD. Is it simply a matter of slapping in another Nvidia M10 and assigning more cores to more VM’s?Thanks in advance, and my apologies of any of these questions have been answered before.Correct observation. And yes, you could add another M10 next year to react on additional growth. In addition to the hardware you will need vApps and QvDWS licenses.regards\\nSimonI realize there will be licensing costs involved. Thank you for the quick reply. I truly appreciate it.Would you recommend starting with an M10? Or is there something better suited to the proposed deployment?Are there any vendor-specific pre-configured servers you would recommend? We typically build our own servers in-house, my usual intel-based 1U-rackmount server will obviously not be ideal in this situation.For professional 3D (like AutoCAD) I would recommend Tesla T4. So it might make more sense to start with 2x T4HiJust to add to Simons comments, although the M10 is still available and fully supported, the fact the architecture is 3 generations superseded should not be overlooked. Bottom line, you’re buying old technology. In my opinion, unless you’re really looking to deliver the cheapest solution, in which case the M10 is perfect (note cheapest, not best), you’re better off with multiple T4s to replace it. The T4s are the latest (Turing) architecture. They support the latest codecs, have better encoding capabilities, more scheduler options, will be supported for longer, use less power and are just generally a more future proof investment over an M10. Also, if you’re running the latest GPU architectures, you can always take advantage of the latest software (vGPU) enhancements.As you have CAD users, making sure you select the proper hardware specifications is even more important. Although you can run CAD on an M10 using QvDWS licensing, it would be my last choice out of the current GPU lineup available. Also, as you’re supporting CAD users, don’t forget the CPU ClockSpeed is critical. Typically, nothing below 3.0Ghz.RegardsMGGentlemen, I appreciate the feedback immensely. And this is the exact kind of input I signed on for. I’ve deployed hundreds of terminal servers over the years, but I’ve never been asked for an AutoCAD capable remote environment.I will look into the T4 GPU’s as recommended.I typically utilize Intel Xeon Silver 4208’s which have a base clock of 2.10GHz and a turbo clock of 3.20GHz, but again, as you’ve seen these systems in production, I’m certainly open to suggestions.-RobSeriously with 2.1GHz? You can never ever count on turbo clock with server systems, therefore this CPU is totally useless for the use case given. As MrGrid mentioned already you should have at least 3Ghz for 3D use cases.HiPlease don’t use 2.1GHz for AutoCAD. Yes it will load and run etc, but the user experience will usually be poor when scrolling in and out, manipulating designs and objects. These CPUs are for entry level workloads, typically classed as \"Digital Worker\", not CAD.Forget about Turbo, there are way too many caveats to get it to work consistently and properly in a virtualised environment and just because the boost clock will go to 3.2GHz, doesn’t mean your users will always get that if or when it the CPU decides to boost. On a physical workstation with no hypervisor, sure, but on a virtualised environment, whole different thing. Then you’re into \"All Core\" vs \"Single Core\" boost and all sorts of other variables that make it deliver inconsistent performance. A far simpler approach is use a CPU with a faster base clock and forget about Turbo. The users will have a far more consistent experience, as the minimum they’ll be working with is 3.xGHz.Either of these two CPUs are fine, however, personally I’d go for the current version (Gen 2)Gen 2 - 18 Core 3.1GHzIntel® Xeon® Gold 6254 Processor (24.75M Cache, 3.10 GHz) quick reference with specifications, features, and technologies.Gen 1 - 18 Core 3.0GHzIntel® Xeon® Gold 6154 Processor (24.75M Cache, 3.00 GHz) quick reference with specifications, features, and technologies.I typically use the 18 Core variants because this gives more flexibility per Host and provides the best balance of Cores vs Clock (there are obviously other CPU variants with either higher Clock or Core count for more specialised use cases). With most OEMs supporting 6 > 8 T4s per Host, having 36 physical cores will allow you to provide the best experience and give you the most headroom for additional density (It’s far easier to add additional GPUs than change out the CPUs when you need additional capacity!).3.xGHz is a bit of a waste for typical Digital Workers, but, you need to look at the overall bigger picture for the hosting environment and whether you want to run RDSH and CAD Workstations on the same physical Hosts. It would be a slightly unusual configuration, but is completely possible and yes you can do it as the Workstations and RDSH VMs would run on different GPUs. Use the software to carve up the platform, not the hardware.Regarding how you support the RDSH and CAD VMs, you can do this in a couple of ways. You can either have two different CPU specifications in your hosting environment (one specification running 2.1GHz and the other running 3.xGHz CPUs) for each workload, or you can have a single specification environment where all hosts are the same and you control performance through the Hypervisor (as mentioned above, again using the software layer, not hardware). My preference would be the single specification as this gives you more flexibility in terms of resilience, migration, maintenance and manageability and it gives you a single price for scaling out the environment. You may or may not be using it, but this is something that Hyperconverged is really good for as everything comes in a single Node. Yes, Hyperconverged is overkill for just this customer, but looking at the bigger picture if you have multiple customers …For the RDSH VMs, allocate each of them the 8A vGPU Profile (8GB of FB) from the T4 (1x vApps license is required per CCU) and change the vGPU Scheduler to Fixed. Changing the Scheduler is really important for the RDSH VMs. Ensure that \"GPU Consolidation\" (named differently depending on the Hypervisor choice) is configured so that the RDSH VMs all end up on the same GPU. The alternative to that setting, depending on your Hypervisor choice, is that you can even select which vGPU Profiles run on which specific GPUs. For example, this means that you could have two T4s that will only run 8A vGPU Profiles, and all other T4s run other vGPU Profiles (except 8A).  What this does, is let you configure a different Scheduler (Best Effort or Fixed) on specific GPUs, and then specific VMs (CAD or RDSH) will only start on those GPUs and have appropriate access to them. You wouldn’t want the CAD VMs running a Fixed Scheduler for example.For the CAD VMs, do some homework first, it’ll save you a lot of issues in the long run. Find out what kind of monitor configurations the CAD users are currently running for a starter (1080P / 2x 1080P / QHD / 4K …) and whether there are plans to upgrade these in the future (if there are, factor that in now, not at a later date). This will at least give you an indication of which vGPU Profile to use initially. Unless they’re doing something crazy, you’ll more than likely be looking at between a 2Q or 4Q vGPU Profile (2GB or 4GB) (QvDWS license is required per CCU (for this specific use case, think of it as per Workstation, it’s easier)). If you’re unsure, go up in vGPU Profile size, not down! The reason for this is simple … If you go down in vGPU Profile size trying to cram on as many users as possible to hit your ROI, and then build out the environment with that specification based on a specific user density (defined by vGPU Profile size) and cost model, and your users suddenly start:… Then you now need to increase the vGPU Profile size by just one step (2Q > 4Q (on a T4)) because there wasn’t enough headroom in your original configuration. As a direct result, you now halve the density of your GPU (platform), meaning you now need to buy more physical servers, or you have to limit the customers in what they want to do, neither of which are good options. If unsure about monitor configurations, again, always go up, so configure for 4K, that way you know you’re going to be covered.Something else you’ll ideally want to do is monitor utilisation of the CAD users existing workstations to see how much resource they’re currently using before deciding on an overall CAD VM profile. You can do this with great little tool called GPUProfiler ( Releases · JeremyMain/GPUProfiler · GitHub ). This tool was created by a friend of mine (Jeremy Main) who works at NVIDIA and who manages and updates it. It’s a portable .exe so no installation is required, just set the amount of time you want it to monitor for and you can export the results in .csv to check resource utilisation (it’s a fantastic tool). This will give you a pretty accurate idea of how much resources are being used. Run this on as many CAD users workstations as possible to get the best range of metrics. Don’t forget to factor in headroom when you configure your spec based on any results!This is something I see a lot. Customers forget that if they get the vGPU sizing wrong by trying to save money at the POC stage, at best, it’s going to halve their server density in a production deployment when updates happen (which they will at some point). This is really important, and something that I hardly ever see talked about.Also remember that SSD / All Flash storage is now a defacto standard with VDI / RDSH. Sometimes NVMe is required, but only for higher performance workloads. Typically (there’s always the odd exception), mechanical spinning disks are now considered for bulk storage only.You haven’t mentioned which protocol you plan to use for the environment ? (HDX 3D Pro, Blast, PCoIP, TGX). You need to check with the CAD users about their peripherals (3d Space Mice, Tablets etc etc) and then make sure they are all supported with your chosen Protocol.Remember, if in doubt, go up in vGPU Profile size. You can always scale down if it’s too much, but you can’t (easily) go up if you start too low.Out of interest, which Thin Client solution are you planning to use?The whole point of my comments above and how I personally work, is to try and mitigate future developments and changes as much as possible so you don’t have to upgrade specifications for the foreseeable future. If you do, it will typically cause issues in one way or another. A lot of things that will cause future issues can be mitigated if taken in to account at the beginning of the deployment. There are always things that catch us out, but the majority of things can easily be planned for. There’s nothing worse than a customer coming along and asking for more performance from a newly deployed platform, only for the system architects / engineers to realise they don’t have it without significant changes.Apologies, I do tend to rattle on when I get going, but there’s a lot to consider and be aware of right from the start so the correct expectations can be set. When deployments under-perform or go wrong, those deploying it have a habit of blaming the technology which is rarely at fault, and it’s typically the person deploying it didn’t understand what they were doing. Not saying that’s the case here, just covering all bases :-)Best of luck! Let us know if you need any guidance.RegardsMGWow, what a summary!!!\\nReally appreciate your effort.Regards\\nSimonGood day once again.And holy-moly your input is invaluable.Clearly the Xeon Silver 4208 isn’t going to cut it. If I’m not going to use the Xeon Silver 4208, I was looking towards Xeon Gold 6244. I will continue to research and look into the processors you’ve recommended. 30 users will be typical \"knowledge workers\" and only 3 users will be \"power users\" requiring access to CAD software (for the time being) and obviously planning ahead/future-proofing as much as possible in the beginning will no doubt save headaches down the road.I am not presently entertaining the idea of building two servers with different hardware configs. If I’m going to build one \"cheap\" server for traditional terminal services, and then another \"expensive\" server for the engineers… I might as well just deploy a terminal server and get the 3 engineers really good desktops. Right now, every employee has their own desktop/laptop PC. Many of which are old and need replacing.I will try to sit down with the engineers and log their utilization. That’s a brilliant looking little app.I haven’t deployed spinning disks in any equipment for years. Worry not on that point. I typically use Samsung for my NVMe devices, and Intel Datacenter SSD’s for 2.5\" applications.I am presently planning to use HYPER-V for everything.For thin clients, either Dell/WYSE terminals or Lenovo. (There will also be several users working remotely using RDP for Mac or RDP on their windows based laptops.)Don’t apologize at all. I came here looking for a wealth of information, from people who have successfully implemented these systems. And I have not been disappointed or overwhelmed at all. Rattle on. Please.HiYou’ve gone a little bit too far the other way regarding CPU choice. Ideally you’re after a balance of Clock vs Cores unless it’s a specific workload you’re targeting. When you move much above 3.0GHz, you start trading Clock for Cores, which is why 3.0 / 3.1GHz is the sweet spot. You “could” look to configure the server with a single socket populated with the 18 Core / 3.1GHz. This would give you the base configuration to scale up when needed, but keep costs down initially. Obviously consider Memory and PCIe architecture at the same time during configuration.There’s a couple of ways in which to configure for 30 Concurrent Digital Workers. You can scale up or out. To scale up, you’ll need the whole T4 assigned to a single VM. Configure CPU and Memory accordingly dependant on testing. As a ball park, start with at least 8 vCPUs and 32GB Memory. Increase as required dependant on testing (I would expect you to need more than that, but those CPU and Memory amounts are a good place to start). My expectation would be that your limiting factor will ultimately be GPU Framebuffer, as this is a hard limit, and I would expect you to hit “approx” 40 > 50 Concurrent users (depending on applications, usage and OS optimisations) if you have a well optimised OS, really light workloads and single 1080P monitors on the client side, then 60 is a strong possibility. But if the users start pushing Google Earth around, you’ll be on the lower end of those numbers. There isn’t a definitive number as there are a lot of variables to consider, but you should be in that area. Much less than that and you have a configuration issue in the stack.The other option (scaling out) is going to be problematic. Unfortunately, out of all the Hypervisors available that support GPUs, Hyper-V is the worst choice for GPU virtualisation (in my opinion). Microsoft (for some reason) made a real mess of adding this. Hyper-V doesn’t actually support vGPU (Plan for GPU acceleration in Windows Server | Microsoft Docs). You can run GPUs in Passthrough (referred to by Microsoft as DDA) but you can’t share the GPU between multiple VMs. You either need to add the whole GPU to a VM, or none of it. That’s ok (it’s not really ok, but it works) with RDSH (kind of), but you’re limited to 1 VM per GPU. Now, if you were running an M10 which has 4 GPUs on it, you can run 4 RDSH VMs (each GPU passed through to a separate VM). But with a T4, where you’d typically split the GPU and run 2 8A vGPU Profiles to support 2 RDSH VMs, all you can do is allocate the whole GPU in Passthrough. So if you go down the Hyper-V route, you’re going to run into limitations very quickly.If you were just running RDSH VMs, this would be ok. Not ideal, but ok. As you could just use M10s to scale out, or a whole T4 to scale up. But you also want to support CAD VMs, and here’s your problem. With XenServer, vSphere, AHV or KVM, you can run all those CAD VMs (3 at the moment) on the same GPU, if they need a 4GB Profile, you have additional capacity for 1 more, if a 2GB Profile you could get 5 more on there. However, with Hyper-V, each CAD VM will need it’s own T4(!) and that’ll blow your cost model right out of the water.Great that you only use SSD / NVMe!Regarding Thin Client choice, make sure you test various models / specifications before deciding on a final model. WYSE, IGEL, 10Zig will all send you evaluations if you request them. It’s also well worth considering using something from NCOMPUTING ( https://www.ncomputing.com/ ) who will also send you one for testing. The NCOMPUTING clients are great little devices that are inexpensive and perform really well, they also have a management platform so can easily be configured before deployment. Regardless of which you select, don’t underestimate the importance of a “good” end point. Just because the back end has high performance components where the heavy lifting is done, doesn’t mean that the end point can be skimped on. Your choice in Protocol will also impact your choice in Thin Client. Treat the solution as an end-to-end system, and every component impacts the user experience.RegardsMGI will take what you’ve said regarding Clock Speed vs Cores/Threads to heart.30 users is the TOTAL number of employees at this point. I wouldn’t expect concurrent users to be above 20.Going with a single CPU for cost-savings isn’t much of a concern. At least not at this point. We’ll see where we’re at when I start putting the final numbers together. (As a side note, where can I see Nvidia licensing costs?)I also realize that HYPER-V is the \"worst\" hypervisor currently available, but, it’s what I’ve been using for over a decade, and I have no experience with VMware, Citrix, Linux, etc.I don’t mind the limitation of dedicating 1 physical GPU per VM. Hence why, initially, I asked about a quad-gpu (M10) to power 4 VM’s. Is there a card like the T4, but with multiple GPU’s per pcb?If I have to start re-thinking my methodology, I certainly will, as Leela’s office poster says; \"You gotta do what you gotta do.\"HiYes, official pricing is available here: https://images.nvidia.com/content/grid/pdf/Virtual-GPU-Packaging-and-Licensing-Guide.pdf However, depending on your location (I’m UK based) I can provide you with a quote if needed, or you can use the NVIDIA Partner Locator ( Find an NVIDIA Partner | NVIDIA ) to find someone who you’re more familiar and comfortable with and / or local to.Going with the single populated socket approach is a good way to build in scalability at a later date but keeping setup costs at a minimum until that extra density or performance is needed. A single 18 Core / 3.1Ghz CPU would easily support your 30 (20 concurrent) users (including 3 CAD VMs). The largest expense outlay is always the first one. After that, components and resources can start to be shared and therefore scaling typically becomes cheaper than the initial outlay. Unless you need everything populated from the start, it’s better to start small but ensure you account for scaling up, otherwise just getting off the ground can be expensive.Hyper-V … When I say worst, it’s important to keep that in context. For GPU virtualisation where you want to share the GPU between multiple workloads or users (which is typically where everything is moving to now), yes, Hyper-V is currently the least favourable to use as Microsoft decided to do their own thing away from the other Hypervisor vendors (Remote-FX, which was limited anyway and still lacking full functionality, but has now been discontinued). Due to a technology shift, it’s now becoming difficult to find consistent uses cases for it where you can get the best out of the technology stack, as is proven in your use case. That said, GPU-P (GPU Partitioning) is coming. However, how this will work with Hyper-V and NVIDIA is unclear at the moment. I’ve not seen much about it to date, but it’s always worth keeping tabs on Azure for indications of what may feed down to Hyper-V in the future. If you wanted to use another Hypervisor but are unsure due to experience, there are ways around that …The only publicly available, supported, Multi-GPU boards are the M10 and M60. There is nothing newer than that which can be purchased with Multi-GPU. After Maxwell, NVIDIA moved to a more software defined offering. This allows for greater development and flexibility, you just need to get passed Maxwell to get the full benefits of it.If you wanted to use Hyper-V with the M10 and use 1 GPU per VM in DDA with scalability for adding more M10s again running in DDA (server dependant), then this will work, but at this stage it’s a limited solution (due to the functionality of Hyper-V and the age of the M10) and you won’t be getting the full benefits out of the technology, but importantly, it will work. Just be aware of the limitations :-)RegardsMGProviding the customer with a crippled solution to start, due to my own shortcomings, obviously isn’t ideal. Clearly this technology is rapidly changing, and staying ahead of the curve is difficult. It looks like the CPU’s are going to be far more expensive than the GPU’s any way you slice it. (I haven’t yet had a chance to look through the licensing costs).Sharing a T4 for the RDSH users doesn’t concern me. It’s not like 20 of them are going to be using Google Earth at the same time.Sharing a single T4 for 3x engineers all trying to use AutoCAD at the same time, however, does concern me. Is the card robust enough for that?HiBaring anything too out of the ordinary in terms of working habits (which is why it’s really important to monitor your customers utilisation and then have them test on a POC before finalising a specification), a single T4 will be more than capable of handling those CAD users. This is due in part to the way in which CAD users typically work, but also in combination with the latest Turing architecture and encoders, however as mentioned above, don’t skimp on the CPU base clock speed.If the CAD users are doing any design or \"creative work\" other than CAD (Rendering for example) then you will need to review the technology options just to be safe and make sure they’re still correct. Again, monitor their utilisation first (including all applications to make sure nothing’s been missed off the test) to confirm how much resource they currently use, then create your platform accordingly. A good indication is to look at their current hardware specifications. If they’re powerful, then they may be doing something resource intensive. If they’re low powered, then maybe they need an upgrade so they can work more freely, but it’s always nice when they move to a more powerful machine, so deliver this if possible.I did touch on this further up, but now you’ve mentioned Hyper-V and RDP connectivity to me, it’s just reminded me … Unless I’m mistaken (wouldn’t be the first time), I’m pretty sure RDP doesn’t support USB forwarding. What this could mean, is that if your CAD users use 3d SpaceMice (like these: 3Dconnexion UK - SpaceMouse, CadMouse, Drivers ) they may not work in your VMs due to RDP. It’s well worth speaking to your CAD users about their peripherals to make sure you know what they use. And those 3d SpaceMice are pretty much industry standard (they’re beautiful, very high quality, precision devices. I have one myself, it’s like working with a piece of jewellery). I’ve done a little digging for you, it would appear that the users in this forum may have a potential solution, although I can’t confirm or recommend it due to not having used it: Remote Desktop use of local Space Navigator - 3Dconnexion Forum Again, you may not need it and it may not be an issue anyway, but double check with all of the CAD users, and make sure you don’t get caught out by their peripherals.The main thing to be aware of with the RDSH users, is Framebuffer and Encoding. As you’ve worked with RDSH a lot, I’m sure you’ll understand just how much memory Google Chrome or other modern browsers can consume when they have multiple tabs open. Even things like MS Office \"expect\" there to be a GPU in the system and are looking to use it by default. When you monitor the GPU utilisation on a loaded RDSH server, you’ll be surprised where the limitations are :-)Don’t beat yourself up, it’s difficult to stay up to date as this kind of technology is evolving fast and we all have our shortcomings. Mine is Networking. I just never got in to it in my early days. I know what my platforms need from a Network and know the very basics, but configuring a Cisco Switch, Router or Firewall would leave me struggling. It’s just not my thing.I’m going to drop you a quick PM on here …RegardsMGto MrGRID: \"I also realize that HYPER-V is the \"worst\" hypervisor currently available, but, it’s what I’ve been using for over a decade, and I have no experience with VMware, Citrix, Linux, etc.\"I do not see any difference between MS DDA and other pass-trough technics: all of them use the same PCIe functions for own goals.Only one difference exist: there is now any profiles to divide such cards (physical PCIe function) as nVidia T4 onto virtual PCIe functions resources like as it do for other hypervisors.Could anybody describe what does it mean word \"GRID\" in MS Windows Server driver without such profiles support?When T4 resources are able to partitioning in ESXi, Xen and KVM, why they are not able to be devided auch a manner for MS DDA?HiAs I mentioned in a previous post further up the thread, the term \"Worst\" needs to be kept in context. \"Worst\" being its overall graphics support. I’m sure Hyper-V may have other advantages, but as I solely work with GPU workloads, I stopped using it many years ago so am not able to articulate them.Passthrough and DDA are the same thing. It’s just Microsoft trying to look like they’re doing something different by calling it something else.When using vGPU, you do not pass the GPU through to the VM(s) (there is no PCIe Passthrough), you allocate a portion of the GPUs Framebuffer through the vGPU Manager and each VMs access to the GPUs resources is time-sliced using its Scheduler. This requires virtualisation, and this is the part that Microsoft do not support.For clarity, NVIDIA vGPU (originally named \"GRID\") is a package of components (Software and Hardware) that form the solution. By using specific GPUs with specific Software, you are using vGPU (GRID).With all of that said, if you look at what NVIDIA have done with the A100, then Microsoft might be an ok choice once NVIDIA release the new graphics line for Tesla and Quadro. We’ll have to wait and see what gets released …RegardsMGThe primary concern to know about with the RDSH clients, is Framebuffer and Encoding. As you’ve worked with RDSH a ton, I’m certain you’ll see exactly how much memory Google Chrome or other current programs can burn-through when they have different tabs open. Indeed, even things like MS Office \"expect\" there to be a GPU in the framework and are hoping to utilize it of coursePowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

Thank you very much for that!  Now Im going to dive into the topic, it looks it is going to be fun. :)Hi there. I’m interested in learning how this was resolved.  I have a similar question on the vGpu license needed for Plex video transcoding in a hyperV Win10 vm with a Tesla P4 passed through.  Want to avoid consuming a vWorkstation license if at all possible.RolandRoland, we did not built it at the end.After 4 years, I just suppose it was because of the price.

This delay time increases when the model file grows.What can we do for this 2-second delay?First of all I would check the power state of the GPU with nvidia-smi to figure out if this may be related. You could for example run a youtube video in the background to see/force power state in P0 and try again. If the behavior is different then there are options to keep the GPU in higher power state.\\nAnother issue is the weak CPU. 2.4Ghz is much to low for Catia and you won’t keep the GPU under load as the CPU is \"overloaded\" already.regards\\nSimonHi,I have similar issue with PTC Creo.CPUs are Intel® Xeon® Gold 6146 12C, 3.20 GHz.Is it possible to force P40 power state to P0 with nvidia-smi?Regards,KárolyPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

The driver installed without no issues, and the cluster is configured according to the vmware documentation. However, during the first test run on one new vdi pool and a single computer, 16Gb of ram, up to 4 monitors, 4 cpus, profile currently being used M10-1q. And, when opening the zoom application, within the vdi, the video barely move. It is like slower than not having a GPU at all.HiCan you confirm that the that VM has successfully acquired a vGPU license?Also, 1GB of FB won’t be enough for 4x monitors, you’ll want to increase that to a larger profile. What resolution are the monitors?RegardsMGHi, at this time we only have two monitors. The resolution on these monitors is 1920x1020.HiAnd the licensing? …RegardsMGNo issues with the license. The issue is with any app (windows can or zoom) using the computer camera. There is like a four almost five seconds delay.HiYes, hence why I asked about the license being applied. If the VM can’t obtain a license, this will reduce the functionality and performance of the GPU and give the exact symptoms you are experiencing. But as you say it’s obtaining a license correctly, we can look at other areas.Is it using the GPU at all? I assume you’re running Windows 10 … Open Task Manager and look at the GPU utilisation. Does it actually get used on anything? Playing a YouTube Video? Encoding the Horizon session? etc etcRegardsMGYes, it is showing on task manager. When playing YouTube video, it shows very minimum CPU utilization. However, when using the windows cam application, or zoom application, the frames per seconds are reduced to almost 4 or 5 seconds delay. Like for example, if I hold my hand in front of the camera, and start to count one to five, the camera will not present the fingers movement for almost 4 seconds or 5 seconds.HiI’ve tried to replicate your issue in my Lab without going too far down the rabbit hole, but I can’t.I quickly built a clean Windows 10 20H2 VM. No Windows Updates. Installed VM Tools, vGPU 11.2 with an M10 1Q Profile,  Horizon Agent 2006 with Direct Connect, current Zoom client and connected directly to it and it works perfectly. Maybe 0.5 seconds lag, but this is completely untuned / optimized and out the box and I threw it together in 20 minutes.I use Instant Clone, not Composer as that’s pretty old now, so am unsure about the options it requires. Maybe check the vGPU settings in there to make sure it’s configured correctly?Other than that, try a clean build like mine above with Direct Connect and see if that works. If it does, then there’s a problem with your Composer settings / agent installation somewhere.You don’t mention which software versions you’re running, but check all your Software and Agent versions, make sure everything is running the latest. I’m running current versions of everything, and no issues, unless it’s with Composer which as said I don’t use.RegardsMGLinked or Instant Clone are just deployment methods, which have no impact on video performance whatsoever. How is this camera being used? Through USB redirection or an optimized way, for instance Zoom VDI plugin or VMware RTAV? USB redirection will get you very bad results, hence the question… Maybe this will help:Ensuring That Real-Time Audio-Video Is Used Instead of USB RedirectionPowered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",

I just tried Windows 10+ Chrome browser. It is still loading after 5 minutes. Can you please look into this?Finally! It took a very long time to load despite having a good internet connection here. I left the tab open and came back to see the course finally loaded up. I wonder if it was a wait due to compute availability on the cloud or something like that. I am sure there would be better way to get this launch process faster. Needs more testing across different geographies and time zones. Thanks for increasing the compute time at the beginning!I am sorry. The usage limit has been exhausted again. Could you please reset/extend the time? I was only 30% into the course.You are all set, I added another four hours.Thanks! It looks like the launch takes a good 10 minutes for this course. This is consistent across different browsers and OS. My internet seems to be fairly fast (but I do not see data download during the loading phase of the course). I kindly request you to bring attention of the course team about this delay in launch. Most times people might try, wait for a while, and assume things to be not working. This only would lead to unnecessary use of instances as the tab is left open assuming things to be still loading.Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript enabled',\n",
